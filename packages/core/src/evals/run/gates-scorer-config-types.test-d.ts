/**
 * Regression tests for issue #21136: `runEvals` accepts `gates` together with a
 * categorized scorer config (`AgentScorerConfig` / `WorkflowScorerConfig`) at
 * runtime, but the TypeScript overloads only declared `gates` alongside a flat
 * `ScorerEntry[]`. Combining `gates` with `scorers: { trajectory: [...] }`
 * therefore failed to compile with TS2769 even though the call works. These are
 * type-level assertions only — no runtime behavior is exercised.
