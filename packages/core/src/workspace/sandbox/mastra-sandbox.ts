/**
 * MastraSandbox Base Class
 *
 * Abstract base class for sandbox providers that want automatic logger integration.
 * Extends MastraBase to receive the Mastra logger when registered with a Mastra instance.
 *
 * MountManager is automatically created if the subclass implements `mount()`.
 * Use `declare readonly mounts: MountManager` to get non-optional typing.
 *
 * ## Lifecycle Management
 *
 * The base class provides race-condition-safe lifecycle wrappers:
 * - `_start()` - Handles concurrent calls, status management, and mount processing
 * - `_stop()` - Handles concurrent calls and status management
 * - `_destroy()` - Handles concurrent calls and status management
 *
 * Subclasses override the plain `start()`, `stop()`, and `destroy()` methods
 * to provide their implementation. Callers use the `_`-prefixed wrappers
 * (or `callLifecycle()`) which add status tracking and race-condition safety.
 *
 * External providers can extend this class to get logger support, or implement
 * the WorkspaceSandbox interface directly if they don't need logging.
