/**
 * Regression test for https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/issues/18280
 *
 * Models that emit an empty reasoning summary (e.g. Anthropic __GATEWAY_ANTHROPIC_MODEL_OPUS__ with
 * thinking `display: omitted`, or OpenAI __AI_SDK_OPENAI_MODEL_BASE__ via the Responses API returning
 * no summary) persist a reasoning part shaped like:
 *
 *   { type: 'reasoning', reasoning: '', details: [{ type: 'text' }] }   // no `text`
 *
 * On the next turn, Observational Memory reloads that message and
 * CacheKeyGenerator.fromAIV4Part crashes:
 *
 *   TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')
 *
 * This is the reasoning-branch sibling of the tool-invocation guard (#16756 /
 * #16773). The cache key generator must handle malformed/empty reasoning parts
 * gracefully instead of crashing the message-loading pipeline.
