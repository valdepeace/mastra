/**
 * Built-in, agent-agnostic tool: submit an implementation plan for user review.
 *
 * Pausing uses the agent-native tool suspension primitive: the tool calls
 * `suspend({ path })`, which makes the agent emit a `tool-call-suspended` event and
 * persist run state. The host validates the plan file path, reads it, renders it,
 * collects an approve/reject decision, and continues the run via `agent.resumeStream({ action,
 * feedback })`; the tool re-runs with `resumeData` set to that decision and reports it
 * back to the model.
 *
 * This tool is deliberately host-agnostic: it does not know about AgentController modes or any
 * UI. A plain Agent (e.g. embedded in Studio or a customer app) can use it directly, and
 * a AgentController can layer mode-switch behavior on top of the approval in its own response
 * handling without the tool needing to change.
 *
 * The tool takes the plan file `path` — never the plan body. The host reads the plan from
 * disk at that path, so more than one plan can exist over time. When executed without an
 * agent `suspend` (e.g. direct invocation outside an agent run), the tool returns the path
 * as readable text so the submission is still surfaced.
