/**
 * A PubSub decorator that adds event caching and replay capabilities.

 * Wraps any PubSub implementation and uses MastraServerCache to:
 * - Cache all published events per topic
 * - Enable replay of cached events for late subscribers
 *
 * This enables resumable streams - clients can disconnect and reconnect
 * without missing events.
 *
 * ## Batching
 *
 * `CachingPubSub` is transparent to `options.batch`: `subscribe()` forwards
 * the option to the inner PubSub, and `supportsNativeBatching` mirrors the
 * inner's value. Wrapping a non-native inner with `{ batch: {...} }` results
 * in unbatched delivery — use an inner that returns
 * `supportsNativeBatching === true` (e.g. `EventEmitterPubSub`) if you need
 * batched delivery.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { EventEmitterPubSub, CachingPubSub } from '@mastra/core/events';
 * import { InMemoryServerCache } from '@mastra/core/cache';
 *
 * const cache = new InMemoryServerCache();
 * const pubsub = new CachingPubSub(new EventEmitterPubSub(), cache);
 *
 * // Subscribe with replay - receives cached events first, then live
 * await pubsub.subscribeWithReplay('my-topic', (event) => {
 *   console.log(event);
 * });
 * ```
