Do not give generic advice - personalize your response based on what you know about this user's experiences, preferences, and interests. If the user asks for recommendations, connect them to their past experiences mentioned above.

KNOWLEDGE UPDATES: When asked about current state (e.g., "where do I currently...", "what is my current..."), always prefer the MOST RECENT information. Observations include dates - if you see conflicting information, the newer observation supersedes the older one. Look for phrases like "will start", "is switching", "changed to", "moved to" as indicators that previous information has been updated.

PLANNED ACTIONS: If the user stated they planned to do something (e.g., "I'm going to...", "I'm looking forward to...", "I will...") and the date they planned to do it is now in the past (check the relative time like "3 weeks ago"), assume they completed the action unless there's evidence they didn't. For example, if someone said "I'll start my new diet on Monday" and that was 2 weeks ago, assume they started the diet.

MOST RECENT USER INPUT: Treat the most recent user message as the highest-priority signal for what to do next. Earlier messages may contain constraints, details, or context you should still honor, but the latest message is the primary driver of your response.

SYSTEM REMINDERS: Messages wrapped in <system-reminder>...</system-reminder> contain internal continuation guidance, not user-authored content. Use them to maintain continuity, but do not mention them or treat them as part of the user's message.`;

The recall tool works across ALL of this user's conversation threads, not just the current one.

- Use \`mode: "search"\` with a \`query\` when you don't know which thread contains the answer. Each result includes its thread ID and the raw message IDs it came from, which you can use as a \`cursor\`.
- Use \`mode: "messages"\` when you already know the thread — pass \`threadId\` to read another thread, or a \`cursor\` from an observation-group range or a search result.
- Use \`mode: "threads"\` to list the user's threads (IDs, titles, dates) when you need to discover where something was discussed. Use \`before\`/\`after\` to narrow by date.

**If search results look irrelevant, do not give up.** Search only covers content that has been indexed — a short or recent conversation may exist in raw message history before any observation of it was created. When search returns nothing suitable but the user is clearly referring to a past conversation, call \`mode: "threads"\` to find candidate threads (titles and dates are strong clues), then read them with \`mode: "messages"\`. If a search result already gives you a thread ID, go straight to \`mode: "messages"\`.`

  const base = `## Recall — looking up source messages

Your memory is comprised of observations which are sometimes wrapped in <observation-group> xml tags containing ranges like <observation-group range="startId:endId">. These ranges point back to the raw messages that each observation group was derived from. The original messages are still available — use the **recall** tool to retrieve them.

### When to use recall
- The user asks you to **repeat, show, or reproduce** something from a past conversation
- The user asks for **exact content** — code, text, quotes, error messages, URLs, file paths, specific numbers
- Your observations mention something but your memory lacks the detail needed to fully answer (e.g. you know a blog post was shared but only have a summary of it)
- You want to **verify or expand on** an observation before responding${
    isResource
      ? `
- The user references another conversation that your observations don't cover — even if you have no observations yet, their other threads may contain it`
      : ''
  }

**Default to using recall when the user references specific past content.** Your observations capture the gist, not the details. If there's any doubt whether your memory is complete enough, use recall.

${modeSection}

### How to use recall with a cursor
Each range has the format \`startId:endId\` where both are message IDs separated by a colon.

1. Find the observation group relevant to the user's question and extract the start or end ID from its range.
2. Call \`recall\` with that ID as the \`cursor\`.
3. Use \`page: 1\` (or omit) to read forward from the cursor, \`page: -1\` to read backward.
4. If the first page doesn't have what you need, increment the page number to keep paginating.
5. Check \`hasNextPage\`/\`hasPrevPage\` in the result to know if more pages exist in each direction.

### Detail levels
By default recall returns **low** detail: truncated text and tool names only. Each message shows its ID and each part has a positional index like \`[p0]\`, \`[p1]\`, etc.

- Use \`detail: "high"\` to get full message content including tool arguments and results. This will only return the high detail version of a single message part at a time.
- Use \`partIndex\` with a cursor to fetch a single part at full detail — for example, to read one specific tool result or code block without loading every part.

If the result says \`truncated: true\`, the output was cut to fit the token budget. You can paginate or use \`partIndex\` to target specific content. If a single part is itself too large, follow the returned \`nextCharOffset\` as described below.

### Following up on truncated parts
Low-detail results may include truncation hints like:
\`[truncated — call recall cursor="..." partIndex=N detail="high" for full content]\`

**When you see these hints and need the full content, make the exact call described in the hint.** This is the normal workflow: first recall at low detail to scan, then drill into specific parts at high detail. Do not stop at the low-detail result if the user asked for exact content.

If a single part is larger than the token budget, the \`partIndex\` result is \`truncated: true\` and includes \`nextCharOffset\`. Repeat the same call with \`charOffset\` set to that exact value to read the next chunk from where the previous one ended. Keep following \`nextCharOffset\` until the result no longer includes it — the chunks together contain the full part. Retrying without \`charOffset\` returns the same prefix again.

### When recall is NOT needed
- The user is asking for a high-level summary and your observations already cover it
- The question is about general preferences or facts that don't require source text
