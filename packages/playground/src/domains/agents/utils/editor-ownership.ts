/**
 * Derives which agent fields the user owns (vs. which are owned by code).
 *
 * These flags MUST mirror the server's getCodeAgentOwnership
 * (packages/server/src/server/handlers/stored-agents.ts): on save the server strips any field a code
 * agent doesn't own. If the client and server disagree, Studio either sends data the server silently
 * drops (looks saved, reloads blank) or hides edits the server would keep.
 *
 * Server semantics for instructions:
 *   editor === false             → not owned (locked)
 *   editor unset (undefined)     → owned — legacy default: an editor-unset code agent is fully editable
 *   editor === true              → not owned (a bare boolean is not an object, so `.instructions` is unset)
 *   editor.instructions === true → owned
 * Server semantics for tools mirror this:
 *   editor unset (undefined)               → owned (membership + descriptions)
 *   editor.tools === true                  → owned (membership + descriptions)
 *   editor.tools === { description: true } → owns tool descriptions only
 *
 * The `undefined` case was the source of a previous bug (for both instructions and tools): `=== true`-only
 * checks made an editor-unset code agent send an empty instructions array and drop tool edits on save,
 * wiping changes the server would have kept.
