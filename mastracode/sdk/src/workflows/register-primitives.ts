/**
 * Statically register workflow-related primitives on the mastracode Mastra
 * instance so `mastra.listTools()` + `mastra.listAgents()` — and, therefore,
 * the workflow-builder's discovery + the workflow rehydrator — see everything
 * a workflow might want to compose:
 *
 *   - workflow-builder sub-agent (so `create-workflow` can delegate)
 *   - code-agent (as a plain agent, callable via agent steps)
 *   - workspace tools (view/write/edit/find_files/execute_command/etc.)
 *   - configured model-independent web tools so workflows can compose search/extract steps
 *   - notification_inbox
 *   - snapshot of MCP tools from mcpManager
 *
 * Called after `controller.init()` but before `startWorkers()` in both boot
 * paths, so `loadStoredWorkflows()` (inside startWorkers) sees the full
 * registry when rehydrating previously-saved workflows.
 *
 * Tradeoffs:
 *   - MCP tools are snapshotted. Servers added after boot are invisible to
 *     the workflow-builder until restart.
 *   - Provider-native (Anthropic/OpenAI) web
 *     tools are skipped because they'd freeze workflows to one model provider.
 *   - Workflow tool steps get the closed-over workspace + auth (web provider
 *     key, MCP server credentials), not per-request permissions — deliberate; if
 *     the user built + saved the workflow they meant to run it.
