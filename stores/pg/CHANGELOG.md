# @mastra/pg

## 1.22.3

### Patch Changes

- Update README to include accurate, up-to-date information ([#22858](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/22858))

- Add `reviewStatus` support to observability feedback storage: new column with migration (defaults to `needs-review`), read/write mapping, `reviewStatus` list filtering, and `updateFeedbackReviewStatus` implementation. ([#22805](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/22805))

- Fixed PgVector failing with "Vector table does not exist" when no schemaName is configured and the connecting role has a same-named schema on its search_path. Catalog lookups used by listIndexes, describeIndex and the namespace migration now resolve through the effective search_path (like the table creation already did) instead of assuming the public schema. Without an explicit schemaName, listIndexes now reports vector tables from every schema on the search_path. Fixes #22545 ([#22827](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/22827))

- Fixed `listResolved()` on versioned storage domains issuing one version query per listed entity. `@mastra/core` adds an overridable `getVersions(ids)` method that `listResolved()` uses to fetch all active versions in a single batch; adapters that don't override it keep their previous per-id behavior. `@mastra/pg` and `@mastra/libsql` override it for the agents and skills domains with a single `WHERE id IN (...)` query. Fixes https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/issues/22524 ([#22828](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/22828))

- Fixed scheduled workflows disappearing from Studio's Schedules tab for dynamically created workflows. Dynamic workflow definitions now persist their schedule configuration, so schedules are re-declared after a restart instead of being deleted as orphans. Schedules of dynamic workflows that fail to load are also kept instead of being swept. Fixes https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/issues/22756 ([#22778](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/22778))

- Remove `CHANGELOG.md` from distributed npm files resulting in reduced package size ([#22737](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/22737))

## 1.22.0

### Minor Changes

- **In-progress traces now appear in Studio with `PostgresStoreVNext`** ([#22137](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/22137))

  `PostgresStoreVNext` previously persisted a span only after it finished, so a long agent run stayed invisible until it completed. It now uses the `event-sourced` tracing strategy: one row is written when a span starts and another when it ends, and reads collapse those rows back into a single span. Traces show up in Studio while the run is executing, and filtering by `running` status works.

  This also fixes duplicate traces from durable runs. A run that suspends and resumes opens a second root span on the same trace, which used to render as two separate entries; the trace list now shows the current root only.

  Writes stay append-only, so throughput is unchanged. The span table gains an `isPending` column, added automatically on `init()` — no manual migration needed. Closes #22054.

- Added native application collection counts so totals no longer load matching rows. ([#22021](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/22021))

  **Before**

  ```ts
  const total = (await storage.ops.findMany('jobs', { status: 'failed' })).length;
  ```

  **After**

  ```ts
  const total = await storage.ops.count?.('jobs', { status: 'failed' });
  ```

- Added namespace isolation to PgVector operations so applications can safely reuse vector indexes across tenants. Existing vectors remain available in the default namespace. ([#22149](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/22149))

  ```ts
  await pgVector.upsert({
    indexName: 'documents',
    vectors,
    ids,
    namespace: 'tenant-123',
  });

  const results = await pgVector.query({
    indexName: 'documents',
    queryVector,
    namespace: 'tenant-123',
  });
  ```

- Added support for filtering scores by metadata key-value pairs in listScores. ([#22047](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/22047))

  ```typescript
  const result = await storage.listScores({
    filters: { metadata: { env: 'prod' } },
  });
  ```

  Each top-level metadata key is matched with exact equality against the stored value. Nested objects and arrays compare structurally (key order doesn't matter) with no partial/subset matching, and an empty metadata filter is a no-op.

### Patch Changes

- Workflow snapshot upserts no longer overwrite a previously stored `resourceId` with NULL when a run is re-persisted without one (for example during resume). ([#22105](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/22105))

- Stop observability filter discovery from re-scanning all history on every refresh ([#22136](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/22136))

  Discovery queries that build Studio's Traces, Logs, and Metrics filter suggestions scanned every span, metric, and log event each time the cache went stale, which grew unbounded with retained data. Refreshes are now bounded to the last 30 days by default (configurable via `observability.discovery.lookbackSeconds`, `0` restores the previous unbounded behaviour), so the planner can prune partitions instead of reading all of them. Only one process refreshes a given cache entry at a time, so running several server instances no longer multiplies the work, and Studio holds discovery results for five minutes instead of refetching on every page mount.

- Fix PostgreSQL observability writes failing on NUL characters and unpaired Unicode surrogates ([#21728](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/21728))

  Span serialization truncated strings by UTF-16 code unit, so a cut inside an emoji left a lone surrogate that PostgreSQL rejected on the jsonb cast (`22P02`). NUL characters were rejected as well (`22P05`). Because observability events are inserted as a single multi-row statement, one malformed field discarded the entire batch.

  Truncation now preserves complete surrogate pairs, and the v-next PostgreSQL observability encoder sanitizes NUL and unpaired surrogates before the jsonb cast, using the same sanitizer that workflow snapshots already rely on. Valid Unicode, including complete emoji, is preserved.

- Experiment results now include isolated metadata snapshots from the dataset items that ran. ([#22005](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/22005))

- Fix `PgFactoryStorage` reads of `json` columns holding a JSON value that isn't an object. ([#22258](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/22258))

  node-pg parses JSONB through its own type parsers, so the value reaching row deserialization is already a JS value. Deserialization parsed it a second time when it was a string, which threw and failed the whole read. Objects and arrays came back as JS objects and never hit that branch, so the defect stayed hidden until a caller stored a string.

  This surfaced through Factory credential encryption, which stores secrets as an opaque envelope string: saving or reading any credential on Postgres threw `Unexpected token ... is not valid JSON`, affecting model provider credentials, integrations, and custom providers. libsql was unaffected, since it stores `json` columns as text where parsing on read is correct.

- Fixed `PgVector` scanning every vector table on startup. Constructing a `PgVector` warms an index cache in the background, and that warmup asked for full index statistics, which include `SELECT COUNT(*)` per table. On a large index that is a full table scan per index, per process start, and the warmup never used the count it paid for. `query()`, `upsert()`, `updateVector()` and the "has this index changed?" check in `createIndex()` paid for the same count. ([#22180](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/22180))

  These paths now read only the index metadata they use (dimension, metric, index type, vector type, index configuration), all of which comes from the Postgres catalog at a cost that does not grow with the size of the table.

  `describeIndex()` is unchanged and still returns an exact `count`:

  ```ts
  const stats = await pgVector.describeIndex({ indexName: 'embeddings' });
  console.log(stats.count); // exact row count, as before
  ```

  Concurrent callers on a cold cache also no longer duplicate the lookup: the first call is shared with everyone waiting on it, and a failed lookup is not cached.

  Fixes [#21952](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/issues/21952).

- Enforce atomic conditional background task state updates so cancellation cannot be overwritten during dispatch. Background task storage is no longer exposed by Cloudflare KV or ClickHouse, which cannot provide the required compare-and-set semantics. ([#22228](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/22228))

  - @mastra/core@1.62.0

## 1.22.0-alpha.4

### Patch Changes

- Stop observability filter discovery from re-scanning all history on every refresh ([#22136](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/22136))

  Discovery queries that build Studio's Traces, Logs, and Metrics filter suggestions scanned every span, metric, and log event each time the cache went stale, which grew unbounded with retained data. Refreshes are now bounded to the last 30 days by default (configurable via `observability.discovery.lookbackSeconds`, `0` restores the previous unbounded behaviour), so the planner can prune partitions instead of reading all of them. Only one process refreshes a given cache entry at a time, so running several server instances no longer multiplies the work, and Studio holds discovery results for five minutes instead of refetching on every page mount.

- Experiment results now include isolated metadata snapshots from the dataset items that ran. ([#22005](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/22005))

- Fix `PgFactoryStorage` reads of `json` columns holding a JSON value that isn't an object. ([#22258](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/22258))

  node-pg parses JSONB through its own type parsers, so the value reaching row deserialization is already a JS value. Deserialization parsed it a second time when it was a string, which threw and failed the whole read. Objects and arrays came back as JS objects and never hit that branch, so the defect stayed hidden until a caller stored a string.

  This surfaced through Factory credential encryption, which stores secrets as an opaque envelope string: saving or reading any credential on Postgres threw `Unexpected token ... is not valid JSON`, affecting model provider credentials, integrations, and custom providers. libsql was unaffected, since it stores `json` columns as text where parsing on read is correct.

- Enforce atomic conditional background task state updates so cancellation cannot be overwritten during dispatch. Background task storage is no longer exposed by Cloudflare KV or ClickHouse, which cannot provide the required compare-and-set semantics. ([#22228](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/22228))

  - @mastra/core@1.62.0-alpha.8

## 1.22.0-alpha.3

### Minor Changes

- Added namespace isolation to PgVector operations so applications can safely reuse vector indexes across tenants. Existing vectors remain available in the default namespace. ([#22149](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/22149))

  ```ts
  await pgVector.upsert({
    indexName: 'documents',
    vectors,
    ids,
    namespace: 'tenant-123',
  });

  const results = await pgVector.query({
    indexName: 'documents',
    queryVector,
    namespace: 'tenant-123',
  });
  ```

### Patch Changes

- Fixed `PgVector` scanning every vector table on startup. Constructing a `PgVector` warms an index cache in the background, and that warmup asked for full index statistics, which include `SELECT COUNT(*)` per table. On a large index that is a full table scan per index, per process start, and the warmup never used the count it paid for. `query()`, `upsert()`, `updateVector()` and the "has this index changed?" check in `createIndex()` paid for the same count. ([#22180](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/22180))

  These paths now read only the index metadata they use (dimension, metric, index type, vector type, index configuration), all of which comes from the Postgres catalog at a cost that does not grow with the size of the table.

  `describeIndex()` is unchanged and still returns an exact `count`:

  ```ts
  const stats = await pgVector.describeIndex({ indexName: 'embeddings' });
  console.log(stats.count); // exact row count, as before
  ```

  Concurrent callers on a cold cache also no longer duplicate the lookup: the first call is shared with everyone waiting on it, and a failed lookup is not cached.

  Fixes [#21952](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/issues/21952).

## 1.22.0-alpha.2

### Minor Changes

- **In-progress traces now appear in Studio with `PostgresStoreVNext`** ([#22137](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/22137))

  `PostgresStoreVNext` previously persisted a span only after it finished, so a long agent run stayed invisible until it completed. It now uses the `event-sourced` tracing strategy: one row is written when a span starts and another when it ends, and reads collapse those rows back into a single span. Traces show up in Studio while the run is executing, and filtering by `running` status works.

  This also fixes duplicate traces from durable runs. A run that suspends and resumes opens a second root span on the same trace, which used to render as two separate entries; the trace list now shows the current root only.

  Writes stay append-only, so throughput is unchanged. The span table gains an `isPending` column, added automatically on `init()` — no manual migration needed. Closes #22054.

## 1.22.0-alpha.1

### Minor Changes

- Added native application collection counts so totals no longer load matching rows. ([#22021](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/22021))

  **Before**

  ```ts
  const total = (await storage.ops.findMany('jobs', { status: 'failed' })).length;
  ```

  **After**

  ```ts
  const total = await storage.ops.count?.('jobs', { status: 'failed' });
  ```

### Patch Changes

- Workflow snapshot upserts no longer overwrite a previously stored `resourceId` with NULL when a run is re-persisted without one (for example during resume). ([#22105](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/22105))

- Fix PostgreSQL observability writes failing on NUL characters and unpaired Unicode surrogates ([#21728](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/21728))

  Span serialization truncated strings by UTF-16 code unit, so a cut inside an emoji left a lone surrogate that PostgreSQL rejected on the jsonb cast (`22P02`). NUL characters were rejected as well (`22P05`). Because observability events are inserted as a single multi-row statement, one malformed field discarded the entire batch.

  Truncation now preserves complete surrogate pairs, and the v-next PostgreSQL observability encoder sanitizes NUL and unpaired surrogates before the jsonb cast, using the same sanitizer that workflow snapshots already rely on. Valid Unicode, including complete emoji, is preserved.

## 1.22.0-alpha.0

### Minor Changes

- Added support for filtering scores by metadata key-value pairs in listScores. ([#22047](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/22047))

  ```typescript
  const result = await storage.listScores({
    filters: { metadata: { env: 'prod' } },
  });
  ```

  Each top-level metadata key is matched with exact equality against the stored value. Nested objects and arrays compare structurally (key order doesn't matter) with no partial/subset matching, and an empty metadata filter is a no-op.

  - @mastra/core@1.62.0-alpha.2

## 1.21.1

### Patch Changes

- Added HTTP endpoints for caller-driven experiments: `POST /datasets/:datasetId/experiments` now accepts `start: false` to create an experiment without spawning the runner (with an optional target and run-level `scorerIds`), and new routes `POST /datasets/:datasetId/experiments/:experimentId/items/:itemId/run`, `POST /datasets/:datasetId/experiments/:experimentId/results`, and `POST /datasets/:datasetId/experiments/:experimentId/finalize` let external orchestrators run one item server-side, submit externally computed per-item results (idempotent upsert on retries), and finalize the run with server-computed counts. ([#21888](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/21888))

- Fixed concurrent resume() calls on the same suspended workflow run executing downstream steps more than once. A resume now atomically claims the run before executing anything, so only one caller continues a given suspension. Losing callers throw WORKFLOW_RESUME_ALREADY_CLAIMED without running any steps. Fixes #20443 ([#21725](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/21725))

- Added `createDatasetExperiment()`, `runExperimentItem()`, `submitExperimentResult()`, and `finalizeExperiment()` methods so a caller-owned orchestrator (for example Temporal) can drive an experiment loop while Mastra either executes each item server-side or ingests externally computed results. ([#21888](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/21888))

- Workflow state updates now support an optional expectedStatus guard, so a status change is only applied when the stored run is in an expected state. This is what makes concurrent workflow resumes safe. ([#21725](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/21725))

- Added `upsertExperimentResult()` to the experiments storage domain plus an `attempt` column on experiment results and a nullable target with an optional `scorerIds` column on experiments, enabling retry-safe result writes for caller-driven experiments (retried submissions with the same `(experimentId, itemId, attempt)` key converge on a single row). `saveScore()` now accepts an optional caller-supplied `id` and upserts on it, so retried experiment submissions replace their previous score rows (latest wins) instead of accumulating duplicates. ([#21888](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/21888))

- Resume conflicts now return 409 Conflict. When a suspended workflow run has already been resumed by another caller, the resume endpoints respond with 409 instead of a generic error. ([#21725](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/21725))

- Added caller-driven experiments so an external orchestrator (for example Temporal workers) can own the experiment loop while Mastra stays the system of record. ([#21888](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/21888))

  Create an experiment with `dataset.createExperiment()` (idempotent when you pass your own id). With a target, Mastra runs each item for you: call `dataset.runExperimentItem()` per item and Mastra executes the registered agent or workflow, resolves scorers (experiment `scorers`, falling back to item `scorerIds`, then dataset `scorerIds`), and upserts the result. Without a target, run everything yourself and report per-item results with `dataset.submitExperimentResult()` (upsert semantics on `(experimentId, itemId, attempt)` so retried workers converge on a single row). Either way, close the run with `dataset.finalizeExperiment()` and Mastra computes per-item succeeded/failed/skipped counts from the persisted rows. Results go into the same storage as native runs, so Studio views, comparisons, and review summaries work unchanged.

  ```typescript
  // Caller drives the loop, Mastra runs each item
  const { experimentId } = await dataset.createExperiment({
    id: workflowRunId,
    targetType: 'agent',
    targetId: 'support-agent',
    scorers: ['accuracy'],
  });

  await dataset.runExperimentItem({ experimentId, itemId });

  // Or: caller runs everything, Mastra ingests results
  const ingest = await dataset.createExperiment({ id: workflowRunId });
  await dataset.submitExperimentResult({
    experimentId: ingest.experimentId,
    itemId,
    output,
    scores: [{ scorerId: 'accuracy', score: 0.92 }],
  });

  const experiment = await dataset.finalizeExperiment({ experimentId });
  ```

  - @mastra/core@1.60.1-alpha.0

## 1.21.0

### Minor Changes

- Added foundational support for an upcoming experimental memory capability across storage, runtime, and developer tooling. ([#19538](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/19538))

### Patch Changes

- Stop a dropped Postgres connection from killing the process while a client is checked out. ([#21765](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/21765))

  `PgFactoryStorage` attached an `error` listener to the pool, but pg only routes pool-level errors for _idle_ clients — it hands ownership of a client to the borrower for the duration of a checkout. A backend restart or network blip that landed on a client mid-transaction therefore reached an emitter with nothing listening, and Node escalated it to an uncaughtException that took the whole server down (`Connection terminated unexpectedly` at `pg/lib/client.js`), even though the idle siblings were logged and discarded cleanly.

  Pools created by `PgFactoryStorage` now attach a listener once per physical connection as it is established, so a client stays covered while borrowed. While the client is idle the pool's own listener already reports the failure, so the extra listener stays quiet and a dropped connection is announced once, as the right thing. The pool still discards the failed connection and reconnects on the next checkout; the failure is now logged instead of fatal. Caller-supplied pools are left untouched, as before.

- Improved workflow run list performance in `@mastra/pg` when filtering by workflow name. The default index avoids sorting the ordered result query for workflows with large run histories. Paginated requests still use a separate count query. ([#21308](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/21308))

- Added a `durable` option to stored agents so agents created through the Agents API can run with durable execution — no code deployment required. ([#21715](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/21715))

  ```typescript
  await mastraClient.createStoredAgent({
    id: 'helper',
    name: 'Helper',
    instructions: 'You are a helpful assistant.',
    model: { provider: 'openai', name: 'gpt-5' },
    durable: true,
  });
  ```

  Pass `true` for defaults, or `{ maxSteps, cleanupTimeoutMs }` to tune the durable loop. Cache and pubsub are inherited from the server's Mastra instance, so configure distributed backends there for durability across replicas. Automatic recovery is still configured in code via `recovery.durableAgents`.

- Improved PgVector upsert performance when writing many vectors at once. Batches are now written with a small number of multi-row inserts instead of one insert per vector, which reduces database round trips and connection pool usage during RAG and memory ingestion. ([#21719](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/21719))

- Make `listWorkflowRuns` status filtering indexable on Postgres. The status predicate previously wrapped every snapshot in a `regexp_replace(snapshot::text, ...)::jsonb` sanitization step, which forced a sequential scan over the whole `mastra_workflow_snapshot` table. On `jsonb` snapshot columns Postgres already rejects the problematic Unicode escape sequences at insert time, so the sanitization was a no-op there and the query now uses a plain `snapshot->>'status'` comparison backed by a new default expression index on `(workflow_name, snapshot->>'status', "createdAt" DESC)`. Legacy tables whose snapshot column is still `json` or `text` keep the sanitizing path. ([#21684](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/21684))

## 1.20.1-alpha.3

### Patch Changes

- Stop a dropped Postgres connection from killing the process while a client is checked out. ([#21765](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/21765))

  `PgFactoryStorage` attached an `error` listener to the pool, but pg only routes pool-level errors for _idle_ clients — it hands ownership of a client to the borrower for the duration of a checkout. A backend restart or network blip that landed on a client mid-transaction therefore reached an emitter with nothing listening, and Node escalated it to an uncaughtException that took the whole server down (`Connection terminated unexpectedly` at `pg/lib/client.js`), even though the idle siblings were logged and discarded cleanly.

  Pools created by `PgFactoryStorage` now attach a listener once per physical connection as it is established, so a client stays covered while borrowed. While the client is idle the pool's own listener already reports the failure, so the extra listener stays quiet and a dropped connection is announced once, as the right thing. The pool still discards the failed connection and reconnects on the next checkout; the failure is now logged instead of fatal. Caller-supplied pools are left untouched, as before.

## 1.20.1-alpha.2

### Patch Changes

- Added a `durable` option to stored agents so agents created through the Agents API can run with durable execution — no code deployment required. ([#21715](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/21715))

  ```typescript
  await mastraClient.createStoredAgent({
    id: 'helper',
    name: 'Helper',
    instructions: 'You are a helpful assistant.',
    model: { provider: 'openai', name: 'gpt-5' },
    durable: true,
  });
  ```

  Pass `true` for defaults, or `{ maxSteps, cleanupTimeoutMs }` to tune the durable loop. Cache and pubsub are inherited from the server's Mastra instance, so configure distributed backends there for durability across replicas. Automatic recovery is still configured in code via `recovery.durableAgents`.

- Improved PgVector upsert performance when writing many vectors at once. Batches are now written with a small number of multi-row inserts instead of one insert per vector, which reduces database round trips and connection pool usage during RAG and memory ingestion. ([#21719](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/21719))

  - @mastra/core@1.60.0-alpha.11

## 1.20.1-alpha.1

### Patch Changes

- Make `listWorkflowRuns` status filtering indexable on Postgres. The status predicate previously wrapped every snapshot in a `regexp_replace(snapshot::text, ...)::jsonb` sanitization step, which forced a sequential scan over the whole `mastra_workflow_snapshot` table. On `jsonb` snapshot columns Postgres already rejects the problematic Unicode escape sequences at insert time, so the sanitization was a no-op there and the query now uses a plain `snapshot->>'status'` comparison backed by a new default expression index on `(workflow_name, snapshot->>'status', "createdAt" DESC)`. Legacy tables whose snapshot column is still `json` or `text` keep the sanitizing path. ([#21684](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/21684))

- Added experiment provenance and grouping support to the LibSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Spanner storage adapters. These fields remain available for later grouping and filtering. ([#20645](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/20645))

  ```ts
  import { PostgresStore } from '@mastra/pg';

  const storage = new PostgresStore({
    id: 'postgres-storage',
    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL!,
  });

  await dataset.startExperiment({
    task,
    scorers,
    provenance: { source: 'github', sourceVersion: 'abc123' },
    grouping: { experimentSetId: 'benchmark-1', variantId: 'candidate', trialIndex: 0 },
  });
  ```

- Memory list reads now surface database errors instead of silently returning empty results. ([#17910](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/17910))

  Previously, the paginated memory reads (`listThreads`, `listMessages`, `listMessagesByResourceId`, and `listMessagesById`) caught backend failures, logged them, and returned an empty payload like `{ threads: [], total: 0, hasMore: false }`. A transient outage (locked table, dropped connection) was therefore indistinguishable from a genuinely empty result, so an agent reading conversation history during a brief failure would treat it as "no history" and could overwrite real state. These methods now re-throw the failure as a `MastraError`. Validation (USER) errors and genuinely empty results are unchanged.

  **Behavior change**

  Callers that previously received an empty result on a backend failure will now receive a thrown `MastraError`. If you call these read methods directly (rather than through an agent, which already surfaces errors), wrap them so a transient outage doesn't crash the caller:

  ```ts
  try {
    const { threads } = await storage.listThreads({ resourceId });
    // ...use threads
  } catch (error) {
    // a real backend failure. Decide whether to retry, surface, or degrade.
    // An empty thread list no longer hides here; it only means "no threads".
  }
  ```

### Patch Changes

- Fixed `include` in `listMessages` and `listMessagesByResourceId` so it can no longer return a message that belongs to a different resource. When you pass a `resourceId`, the target message and its surrounding context messages now stay inside that resource. Includes that cross threads inside the same resource keep working, so semantic recall with `scope: 'resource'` is unchanged. ([#20984](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/20984))

  **Behaviour change in the in-memory store**

  The in-memory store read the context window from the thread you queried. It now reads the window from the thread that owns the target message, which is what the SQL stores already did. This only changes the result when an `include` entry names a message from another thread.

  The in-memory store also ignored `include` in `listMessagesByResourceId`. It now returns the included messages, like `@mastra/libsql` and `@mastra/pg` do.

  Fixes #20604.

- Improved chat response time with PostgresStore. Message history now reads a page of messages and its total count in one query instead of two. When semantic recall is on, the recall read also starts at the same time as the page read. Each agent turn therefore makes fewer database round-trips, which is most noticeable on remote Postgres. ([#20979](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/20979))

- Fixed PgVector top-level metadata equality filters so configured B-tree metadata indexes can match filtered vector queries. ([#20789](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/20789))

- Fixed a crash where updating a thread without a title (for example during observational memory buffering) could write a null title and violate the database's not-null constraint when running a newer @mastra/memory against an older storage package. Memory now checks whether the connected storage adapter supports partial thread updates and backfills the existing title for older adapters, so mixed-version deployments keep working. See #21041 for the original title-clobbering fix this makes backward compatible. ([#21257](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/21257))

- Storage adapters now declare support for partial thread updates, letting newer @mastra/memory preserve existing thread titles instead of overwriting them, while remaining safe against older versions. ([#21257](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/21257))

- Add a persistent `threadState` domain to `PostgresStore` ([#20994](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/20994))

  `PostgresStore` did not register a `threadState` domain, so durable task and goal
  state fell back to in-memory storage and was lost on restart. Anything relying on
  thread state (task tools, long-running agent goals) could not be backed by Postgres
  alone, and required composing a second adapter through `MastraCompositeStore`.

  `ThreadStatePG` now stores state as JSONB keyed by `(threadId, type)` with an atomic
  upsert that preserves `createdAt`, participates in `exportSchemas()` and `init()`, and
  supports retention pruning anchored on `updatedAtZ` so state for still-active threads
  survives age-based pruning.

- Fixed generated thread titles being clobbered during a turn ([#21041](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/21041))

  `updateThread` required both `title` and `metadata`, so callers that only needed to
  change metadata (message persistence, working memory, observational memory, channel
  subscriptions) had to read the thread and pass its title back. When title generation
  finished between that read and the write, the freshly generated title was overwritten
  with the stale one.

  `title` and `metadata` are now independently optional: omitting one leaves that column
  untouched. Callers that only change metadata no longer send a title, and message
  persistence no longer rewrites a thread row it just read.

- Fixed transaction completion when applications start several database operations at the same time. Pending operations now finish before the transaction completes or is cancelled, preventing query conflicts after batch failures and operations that application code does not await. ([#20869](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/20869))

- Fixed PostgreSQL memory timestamps to stay aligned across server timezones. ([#20831](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/20831))

- Updated dependencies [[`e7109ee`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/e7109ee6f731bacc79c885906f3c7dca8d8f013a),

  - @mastra/core@1.58.0

## 1.20.0-alpha.4

### Patch Changes

- Fixed a crash where updating a thread without a title (for example during observational memory buffering) could write a null title and violate the database's not-null constraint when running a newer @mastra/memory against an older storage package. Memory now checks whether the connected storage adapter supports partial thread updates and backfills the existing title for older adapters, so mixed-version deployments keep working. See #21041 for the original title-clobbering fix this makes backward compatible. ([#21257](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/21257))

- Storage adapters now declare support for partial thread updates, letting newer @mastra/memory preserve existing thread titles instead of overwriting them, while remaining safe against older versions. ([#21257](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/21257))

- Updated dependencies [[`dc4a25d`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/dc4a25d41af4e2fe97a816070eaec6aa963ab53b), [`dc4a25d`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/dc4a25d41af4e2fe97a816070eaec6aa963ab53b)]:
  - @mastra/core@1.58.0-alpha.15

## 1.20.0-alpha.3

### Patch Changes

- Fixed generated thread titles being clobbered during a turn ([#21041](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/21041))

  `updateThread` required both `title` and `metadata`, so callers that only needed to
  change metadata (message persistence, working memory, observational memory, channel
  subscriptions) had to read the thread and pass its title back. When title generation
  finished between that read and the write, the freshly generated title was overwritten
  with the stale one.

  `title` and `metadata` are now independently optional: omitting one leaves that column
  untouched. Callers that only change metadata no longer send a title, and message
  persistence no longer rewrites a thread row it just read.

- Updated dependencies [[`1c75e32`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/1c75e32f7fc0b9fb6f548b4407feaec8a1440212), [`c47165c`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/c47165c983c87594c6952f1fd2fa51a90205034c), [`e08e789`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/e08e789c1bf4cd2fe46363f7a4728536ceccc9bd), [`35cc901`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/35cc90102cf834a84827acaf9eee0b6d6d1e2a3b), [`a8b4cf0`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/a8b4cf02823cffebc4751a53337dfacf097c1ae1), [`f33264f`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/f33264f517ae603279afd5c4251e2b40f6dd3618), [`689f2c4`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/689f2c4b6c0835fe455702b01d21daa8abcd9331), [`eeae63e`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/eeae63e7fbe8e1f237adc69bca6e2ac13c5ca907), [`4c186a0`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/4c186a017275f45e6ed4c09de0f89550e2d09e8c), [`b0fa077`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/b0fa077bcbc9b08551846fe372a0d3d15b71ed72)]:
  - @mastra/core@1.58.0-alpha.8

## 1.20.0-alpha.2

### Patch Changes

- Fixed `include` in `listMessages` and `listMessagesByResourceId` so it can no longer return a message that belongs to a different resource. When you pass a `resourceId`, the target message and its surrounding context messages now stay inside that resource. Includes that cross threads inside the same resource keep working, so semantic recall with `scope: 'resource'` is unchanged. ([#20984](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/20984))

  **Behaviour change in the in-memory store**

  The in-memory store read the context window from the thread you queried. It now reads the window from the thread that owns the target message, which is what the SQL stores already did. This only changes the result when an `include` entry names a message from another thread.

  The in-memory store also ignored `include` in `listMessagesByResourceId`. It now returns the included messages, like `@mastra/libsql` and `@mastra/pg` do.

  Fixes #20604.

- Add a persistent `threadState` domain to `PostgresStore` ([#20994](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/20994))

  `PostgresStore` did not register a `threadState` domain, so durable task and goal
  state fell back to in-memory storage and was lost on restart. Anything relying on
  thread state (task tools, long-running agent goals) could not be backed by Postgres
  alone, and required composing a second adapter through `MastraCompositeStore`.

  `ThreadStatePG` now stores state as JSONB keyed by `(threadId, type)` with an atomic
  upsert that preserves `createdAt`, participates in `exportSchemas()` and `init()`, and
  supports retention pruning anchored on `updatedAtZ` so state for still-active threads
  survives age-based pruning.

## 1.20.0-alpha.1

### Patch Changes

- Improved chat response time with PostgresStore. Message history now reads a page of messages and its total count in one query instead of two. When semantic recall is on, the recall read also starts at the same time as the page read. Each agent turn therefore makes fewer database round-trips, which is most noticeable on remote Postgres.

  - @mastra/core@1.58.0-alpha.3

## 1.20.0-alpha.0

### Minor Changes

- Added experiment provenance and grouping support to the LibSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Spanner storage adapters. These fields remain available for later grouping and filtering. ([#20645](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/20645))

  ```ts
  import { PostgresStore } from '@mastra/pg';

  const storage = new PostgresStore({
    id: 'postgres-storage',
    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL!,
  });

  await dataset.startExperiment({
    task,
    scorers,
    provenance: { source: 'github', sourceVersion: 'abc123' },
    grouping: { experimentSetId: 'benchmark-1', variantId: 'candidate', trialIndex: 0 },
  });
  ```

- Memory list reads now surface database errors instead of silently returning empty results. ([#17910](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/17910))

  Previously, the paginated memory reads (`listThreads`, `listMessages`, `listMessagesByResourceId`, and `listMessagesById`) caught backend failures, logged them, and returned an empty payload like `{ threads: [], total: 0, hasMore: false }`. A transient outage (locked table, dropped connection) was therefore indistinguishable from a genuinely empty result, so an agent reading conversation history during a brief failure would treat it as "no history" and could overwrite real state. These methods now re-throw the failure as a `MastraError`. Validation (USER) errors and genuinely empty results are unchanged.

  **Behavior change**

  Callers that previously received an empty result on a backend failure will now receive a thrown `MastraError`. If you call these read methods directly (rather than through an agent, which already surfaces errors), wrap them so a transient outage doesn't crash the caller:

  ```ts
  try {
    const { threads } = await storage.listThreads({ resourceId });
    // ...use threads
  } catch (error) {
    // a real backend failure. Decide whether to retry, surface, or degrade.
    // An empty thread list no longer hides here; it only means "no threads".
  }
  ```

### Patch Changes

- Fixed PgVector top-level metadata equality filters so configured B-tree metadata indexes can match filtered vector queries. ([#20789](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/20789))

- Fixed transaction completion when applications start several database operations at the same time. Pending operations now finish before the transaction completes or is cancelled, preventing query conflicts after batch failures and operations that application code does not await. ([#20869](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/20869))

- Fixed PostgreSQL memory timestamps to stay aligned across server timezones. ([#20831](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/20831))

  - @mastra/core@1.58.0-alpha.1

## 1.19.0

### Minor Changes

- Added batch trace ID filtering to observability metric queries. ([#20535](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/20535))

  ```ts
  const result = await observability.getMetricBreakdown({
    name: ['mastra_model_total_input_tokens'],
    aggregation: 'sum',
    groupBy: ['traceId'],
    filters: { traceIds: ['trace-1', 'trace-2'] },
  });
  ```

- Added persistence for dataset item undeclared tool policies. ([#19643](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/19643))

  ```typescript
  await dataset.addItem({
    input: 'What is the weather?',
    unmockedToolPolicy: 'deny',
  });
  ```

- Stored workflow definitions now persist across restarts on every major database backend. ([#20471](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/20471))

  Implement the `workflowDefinitions` storage domain for libsql, pg, mysql, mssql, mongodb, and spanner. Previously the stored-workflow persistence path (`POST /stored/workflows`, `Mastra.addStoredWorkflow`) only worked against `@mastra/core`'s in-memory store. Persistent adapters returned `undefined` from `storage.getStore('workflowDefinitions')` and threw when the HTTP handler tried to read/write a workflow.

  ```ts
  const workflowDefinitions = await storage.getStore('workflowDefinitions');
  if (!workflowDefinitions) {
    throw new Error('This storage adapter does not support the workflowDefinitions domain');
  }

  await workflowDefinitions.upsert({
    id: 'greeting-workflow',
    inputSchema: { type: 'object', properties: { name: { type: 'string' } }, required: ['name'] },
    outputSchema: { type: 'object', properties: { text: { type: 'string' } }, required: ['text'] },
    graph: [{ type: 'agent', id: 'greet', agentId: 'greeter-agent' }],
  });

  const { definitions, total } = await workflowDefinitions.list({ status: 'active' });
  const definition = await workflowDefinitions.get('greeting-workflow');
  await workflowDefinitions.delete('greeting-workflow');
  ```

  Each adapter now ships a `WorkflowDefinitions*` domain that:

  - Creates the shared `mastra_workflow_definitions` table (or Mongo collection) from `WORKFLOW_DEFINITIONS_SCHEMA` during `init()`, plus a default index on `status`.
  - Implements `upsert` / `get` / `list` / `delete` matching `WorkflowDefinitionsStorage` semantics (`list` supports `status` and `authorId` filters and orders by `updatedAt` desc). Partial upserts preserve unspecified fields, including `authorId` updates and `createdAt` / `updatedAt` semantics.
  - Handles concurrent first-writes race-safely: if two callers upsert the same new id simultaneously, the losing insert detects the duplicate key, re-reads the row, and applies the partial-update path instead of failing.
  - Round-trips the JSON columns (`inputSchema`, `outputSchema`, `stateSchema`, `requestContextSchema`, `metadata`, `graph`) through each adapter's JSON handling, so declarative workflow graphs rehydrate identically no matter which backend they were stored in. Malformed persisted JSON surfaces as an actionable error naming the row and column instead of hydrating raw strings.

  Exported class names by adapter: `WorkflowDefinitionsLibSQL`, `WorkflowDefinitionsPG`, `WorkflowDefinitionsMySQL`, `WorkflowDefinitionsMSSQL`, `MongoDBWorkflowDefinitionsStore`, `WorkflowDefinitionsSpanner`. The composite stores (`LibSQLStore`, `PostgresStore`, `MySQLStore`, `MSSQLStore`, `MongoDBStore`, `SpannerStore`) auto-wire the new domain, so callers do not need to construct it manually — `storage.getStore('workflowDefinitions')` now returns a live handle.

  The pg adapter reads `createdAt` / `updatedAt` from the auto-added `createdAtZ` / `updatedAtZ` `timestamptz` companion columns to avoid the naive-timestamp / local-TZ drift that a plain `TIMESTAMP` read exhibits under node-pg.

  `@mastra/clickhouse` and `@mastra/cloudflare` register the new `mastra_workflow_definitions` table in their table/type maps so shared table constants stay exhaustive (no workflow-definitions domain implementation yet).

### Patch Changes

- Added a comment column to experiment results so review comments persist. The column is added automatically and non-destructively on startup for existing databases (https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/issues/19857). ([#19865](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/19865))

- Dataset item scorer selections now persist across PostgreSQL writes and reads. Setting `scorerIds` to `null` clears an item override, while `[]` remains an explicit override with no scorers. ([#20191](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/20191))

  ```typescript
  await dataset.addItem({
    input: 'Evaluate this response',
    scorerIds: [],
  });
  ```

- Improved PostgresStore startup: init now reads the schema catalog up front (3 read-only queries) instead of issuing hundreds of per-object existence checks and no-op DDL statements. On an already-migrated database this cuts init from ~350 serialized queries to 6, dropping init time on a 50ms connection from ~18.5s to ~0.5s. Fixed init failing for roles without CREATE privileges when the schema already exists, and removed a table lock that could block writers while init re-created triggers that were already in place. Fresh and partially-migrated databases are set up exactly as before. ([#20394](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/20394))

- Fixed nine storage adapters declaring a `@mastra/core` peer range that permitted core versions too old to load them. Each adapter imports `storageMessageMatchesMetadataFilter` from `@mastra/core/storage`, which core only exports from 1.53.0, but every one of them still advertised a floor below that — as low as `>=1.0.0-0`. Package managers accepted the incompatible pair without a warning and the install then failed at import time: ([#20591](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/20591))

  ```
  SyntaxError: The requested module '@mastra/core/storage' does not provide an export named 'storageMessageMatchesMetadataFilter'
  ```

  All nine now declare `>=1.53.0-0 <2.0.0-0`, so npm and pnpm surface a peer conflict at install time instead of letting the project break on first import.

  Fixes [#20586](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/issues/20586).

## 1.19.0-alpha.2

### Minor Changes

- Stored workflow definitions now persist across restarts on every major database backend. ([#20471](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/20471))

  Implement the `workflowDefinitions` storage domain for libsql, pg, mysql, mssql, mongodb, and spanner. Previously the stored-workflow persistence path (`POST /stored/workflows`, `Mastra.addStoredWorkflow`) only worked against `@mastra/core`'s in-memory store. Persistent adapters returned `undefined` from `storage.getStore('workflowDefinitions')` and threw when the HTTP handler tried to read/write a workflow.

  ```ts
  const workflowDefinitions = await storage.getStore('workflowDefinitions');
  if (!workflowDefinitions) {
    throw new Error('This storage adapter does not support the workflowDefinitions domain');
  }

  await workflowDefinitions.upsert({
    id: 'greeting-workflow',
    inputSchema: { type: 'object', properties: { name: { type: 'string' } }, required: ['name'] },
    outputSchema: { type: 'object', properties: { text: { type: 'string' } }, required: ['text'] },
    graph: [{ type: 'agent', id: 'greet', agentId: 'greeter-agent' }],
  });

  const { definitions, total } = await workflowDefinitions.list({ status: 'active' });
  const definition = await workflowDefinitions.get('greeting-workflow');
  await workflowDefinitions.delete('greeting-workflow');
  ```

  Each adapter now ships a `WorkflowDefinitions*` domain that:

  - Creates the shared `mastra_workflow_definitions` table (or Mongo collection) from `WORKFLOW_DEFINITIONS_SCHEMA` during `init()`, plus a default index on `status`.
  - Implements `upsert` / `get` / `list` / `delete` matching `WorkflowDefinitionsStorage` semantics (`list` supports `status` and `authorId` filters and orders by `updatedAt` desc). Partial upserts preserve unspecified fields, including `authorId` updates and `createdAt` / `updatedAt` semantics.
  - Handles concurrent first-writes race-safely: if two callers upsert the same new id simultaneously, the losing insert detects the duplicate key, re-reads the row, and applies the partial-update path instead of failing.
  - Round-trips the JSON columns (`inputSchema`, `outputSchema`, `stateSchema`, `requestContextSchema`, `metadata`, `graph`) through each adapter's JSON handling, so declarative workflow graphs rehydrate identically no matter which backend they were stored in. Malformed persisted JSON surfaces as an actionable error naming the row and column instead of hydrating raw strings.

  Exported class names by adapter: `WorkflowDefinitionsLibSQL`, `WorkflowDefinitionsPG`, `WorkflowDefinitionsMySQL`, `WorkflowDefinitionsMSSQL`, `MongoDBWorkflowDefinitionsStore`, `WorkflowDefinitionsSpanner`. The composite stores (`LibSQLStore`, `PostgresStore`, `MySQLStore`, `MSSQLStore`, `MongoDBStore`, `SpannerStore`) auto-wire the new domain, so callers do not need to construct it manually — `storage.getStore('workflowDefinitions')` now returns a live handle.

  The pg adapter reads `createdAt` / `updatedAt` from the auto-added `createdAtZ` / `updatedAtZ` `timestamptz` companion columns to avoid the naive-timestamp / local-TZ drift that a plain `TIMESTAMP` read exhibits under node-pg.

  `@mastra/clickhouse` and `@mastra/cloudflare` register the new `mastra_workflow_definitions` table in their table/type maps so shared table constants stay exhaustive (no workflow-definitions domain implementation yet).

### Minor Changes

- Added exact metadata filtering to message history queries across Memory APIs and supported storage providers. ([#19991](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/19991))

  ```ts
  const messages = await memory.recall({
    threadId: 'thread-1',
    filter: {
      metadata: {
        status: 'done',
        priority: 'high',
      },
    },
  });
  ```

  Multiple fields use AND semantics. Supported values are strings, finite numbers, booleans, and `null`.

### Patch Changes

- Observational-memory settings no longer fail with "No session for resourceId" on the settings page: OM config routes now treat the live session as best-effort sync and fall back to the durably stored per-user settings when no agent-controller session exists for the resource (e.g. after a server restart), so settings load and save instead of 404ing ([#20265](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/20265))

- Fixed session creation ignoring an exact thread id when the session was already live. Requesting a session with a threadId now resumes or creates that exact thread even when another request (like an event subscription or message listing) created the session first, preventing 'Thread not found' errors for workspace threads. ([#20265](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/20265))

- Fixed a crash where the server process exited when an idle Postgres connection in the PgFactoryStorage pool dropped (for example after a network change or database restart). The pool now discards the broken connection, logs a warning, and reconnects on the next query. ([#20265](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/20265))

- Fixed Postgres startup failures when multiple API and worker processes initialize the same schema simultaneously. ([#19652](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/19652))

- Fixed Factory sessions failing to start their kickoff run.

## 1.18.0-alpha.1

### Patch Changes

- Observational-memory settings no longer fail with "No session for resourceId" on the settings page: OM config routes now treat the live session as best-effort sync and fall back to the durably stored per-user settings when no agent-controller session exists for the resource (e.g. after a server restart), so settings load and save instead of 404ing ([#20265](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/20265))

- Fixed session creation ignoring an exact thread id when the session was already live. Requesting a session with a threadId now resumes or creates that exact thread even when another request (like an event subscription or message listing) created the session first, preventing 'Thread not found' errors for workspace threads. ([#20265](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/20265))

- Fixed a crash where the server process exited when an idle Postgres connection in the PgFactoryStorage pool dropped (for example after a network change or database restart). The pool now discards the broken connection, logs a warning, and reconnects on the next query. ([#20265](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/20265))

- Fixed Factory sessions failing to start their kickoff run. Workspaces now recover automatically when the sandbox provider changes or a sandbox is wiped (the repository is re-cloned instead of failing), thread pages surface workspace preparation errors with a Retry button instead of hanging, and kickoff messages are now delivered to the session thread instead of silently failing with a permissions error. ([#20265](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/20265))

### Minor Changes

- Added exact metadata filtering to message history queries across Memory APIs and supported storage providers. ([#19991](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/19991))

  ```ts
  const messages = await memory.recall({
    threadId: 'thread-1',

      },
    },
  });
  ```

  Multiple fields use AND semantics. Supported values are strings, finite numbers, booleans, and `null`.

  - @mastra/core@1.53.0-alpha.4

## 1.17.0

### Minor Changes

- Added PgFactoryStorage for persisting Mastra agent state and lifecycle-managed application domains through one PostgreSQL pool. ([#19681](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/19681))

  ```ts
  import { PgFactoryStorage } from '@mastra/pg';

  const storage = new PgFactoryStorage({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL! });
  await storage.init();
  ```

### Patch Changes

- Fixed a missing semicolon in the SQL generated by exportSchemas(). The CREATE INDEX statement for the favorites table ran into the next CREATE TABLE statement, so applying the exported schema as a single query (for example with pg's client.query() or a Supabase migration) failed with a Postgres syntax error. Fixes https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/issues/19942 ([#19944](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/19944))

- Replaced GitHub-specific Mastra Code session state with Factory project and linked-repository identities. This lets SDK consumers represent sessions independently of a source-control provider and select a repository explicitly when sandbox execution is required. ([#19849](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/19849))

  Updated Mastra Code onboarding to be Factory-first: create a Factory by name, then link repositories from your connected source-control installations in a separate step. A Factory is valid with zero linked repositories, and the Board, Metrics, and Audit pages stay available for any server-backed Factory. Factory pages keep project-scoped data separate from repository-scoped intake and provide a repository selector when a Factory has multiple linked repositories. Creating a Factory from a local folder remains available as a secondary option.

  **Before**

  ```ts
  const state = { githubProjectId: 'project-1', sandboxId, sandboxWorkdir };
  ```

  **After**

  ```ts
  const state = {
    factoryProjectId: 'factory-project-1',
    projectRepositoryId: 'project-repository-1',
    sandboxId,
    sandboxWorkdir,
  };
  ```

- Fixed an issue where the process could crash when Postgres drops an idle database connection (e.g., due to a backend restart, failover, or network failure). ([#19469](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/19469))

  Previously, a dropped idle connection caused an uncaught exception that terminated the process. Now the connection drop is caught and logged as a warning, and the store automatically reconnects on the next database operation.

  User-provided connection pools are unaffected and keep their existing error handling.

- Fix factory storage error classification and schema drift handling. ([#20002](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/20002))

  - `isUniqueViolation` in the LibSQL factory storage now only matches real unique-index violations (`SQLITE_CONSTRAINT_UNIQUE` / `SQLITE_CONSTRAINT_PRIMARYKEY`). Previously any `SQLITE_CONSTRAINT` failure — including NOT NULL violations — was reported as a "Unique constraint violation", which masked the real error (seen as `Unique constraint violation on collection 'factory_rule_evaluations'` when polled ingestion inserted nullable columns into a stale table).
  - `ensureCollections` in both the LibSQL and Postgres factory storage adapters now relaxes stale NOT NULL constraints when a column becomes nullable in the schema. Postgres uses `ALTER COLUMN ... DROP NOT NULL`; LibSQL rebuilds the table in place since SQLite cannot drop NOT NULL directly. Existing rows and unique indexes are preserved.

- Added stable metrics and logs capability reporting for observability storage. The system packages response now includes `observabilityStorageCapabilities` with `metrics` and `logs` flags, enabling capability-based detection that is resilient to bundler-generated constructor name changes. ([#19305](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/19305))

  ```typescript
  const packages = await client.getSystemPackages();
  console.log(packages.observabilityStorageCapabilities?.metrics); // true
  console.log(packages.observabilityStorageCapabilities?.logs); // true
  ```

  Studio now uses the capability response instead of relying on constructor names, with a fallback for older servers.

  - @mastra/core@1.52.0

## 1.17.0-alpha.4

### Patch Changes

- Fix factory storage error classification and schema drift handling. ([#20002](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/20002))

  - `isUniqueViolation` in the LibSQL factory storage now only matches real unique-index violations (`SQLITE_CONSTRAINT_UNIQUE` / `SQLITE_CONSTRAINT_PRIMARYKEY`). Previously any `SQLITE_CONSTRAINT` failure — including NOT NULL violations — was reported as a "Unique constraint violation", which masked the real error (seen as `Unique constraint violation on collection 'factory_rule_evaluations'` when polled ingestion inserted nullable columns into a stale table).
  - `ensureCollections` in both the LibSQL and Postgres factory storage adapters now relaxes stale NOT NULL constraints when a column becomes nullable in the schema. Postgres uses `ALTER COLUMN ... DROP NOT NULL`; LibSQL rebuilds the table in place since SQLite cannot drop NOT NULL directly. Existing rows and unique indexes are preserved.

- Updated dependencies:
  - @mastra/core@1.52.0-alpha.13

## 1.17.0-alpha.3

### Patch Changes

- Fixed a missing semicolon in the SQL generated by exportSchemas(). The CREATE INDEX statement for the favorites table ran into the next CREATE TABLE statement, so applying the exported schema as a single query (for example with pg's client.query() or a Supabase migration) failed with a Postgres syntax error. Fixes https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/issues/19942 ([#19944](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/19944))

## 1.17.0-alpha.2

### Patch Changes

- Replaced GitHub-specific Mastra Code session state with Factory project and linked-repository identities. This lets SDK consumers represent sessions independently of a source-control provider and select a repository explicitly when sandbox execution is required. ([#19849](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/19849))

  Updated Mastra Code onboarding to be Factory-first: create a Factory by name, then link repositories from your connected source-control installations in a separate step. A Factory is valid with zero linked repositories, and the Board, Metrics, and Audit pages stay available for any server-backed Factory. Factory pages keep project-scoped data separate from repository-scoped intake and provide a repository selector when a Factory has multiple linked repositories. Creating a Factory from a local folder remains available as a secondary option.

  **Before**

  ```ts
  const state = { githubProjectId: 'project-1', sandboxId, sandboxWorkdir };
  ```

  **After**

  ```ts
  const state = {
    factoryProjectId: 'factory-project-1',
    projectRepositoryId: 'project-repository-1',
    sandboxId,
    sandboxWorkdir,
  };
  ```

  - @mastra/core@1.52.0-alpha.10

## 1.17.0-alpha.1

### Minor Changes

- Added PgFactoryStorage for persisting Mastra agent state and lifecycle-managed application domains through one PostgreSQL pool. ([#19681](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/19681))

  ```ts
  import { PgFactoryStorage } from '@mastra/pg';

  - @mastra/core@1.52.0-alpha.8

## 1.16.1-alpha.0

### Patch Changes

- Fixed an issue where the process could crash when Postgres drops an idle database connection (e.g., due to a backend restart, failover, or network failure). ([#19469](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/19469))

  Previously, a dropped idle connection caused an uncaught exception that terminated the process. Now the connection drop is caught and logged as a warning, and the store automatically reconnects on the next database operation.

  User-provided connection pools are unaffected and keep their existing error handling.

- Added stable metrics and logs capability reporting for observability storage. The system packages response now includes `observabilityStorageCapabilities` with `metrics` and `logs` flags, enabling capability-based detection that is resilient to bundler-generated constructor name changes. ([#19305](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/19305))

  ```typescript
  const packages = await client.getSystemPackages();
  console.log(packages.observabilityStorageCapabilities?.metrics); // true
  console.log(packages.observabilityStorageCapabilities?.logs); // true
  ```

  Studio now uses the capability response instead of relying on constructor names, with a fallback for older servers.

  - @mastra/core@1.52.0-alpha.3

## 1.16.0

### Minor Changes

- Added atomic caller-defined dataset IDs for idempotent dataset creation across built-in storage adapters. Supplying `id` to `mastra.datasets.create()` now creates the dataset once and resolves compatible retries to the persisted record; incompatible immutable identity fields throw `DATASET_ID_CONFLICT`. ([#19370](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/19370))

- Added caller-defined dataset item identities for safe retries across all dataset storage adapters. ([#19384](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/19384))

  Dataset items can now include an `externalId` when calling `addItem` or `addItems`:

  ```ts
  await dataset.addItem({
    externalId: 'source-item-123',
    input: { prompt: 'Hello' },
  });
  ```

  Retrying with the same identity and payload returns the existing item. Reusing an identity with different content returns a typed conflict, including during concurrent writes. Updates and deletes preserve the identity, Spanner retries transactions without changing the outcome, and MySQL batch writes now preserve every supported dataset item field.

### Patch Changes

- Raised the `@mastra/core` peer dependency floor to `>=1.51.0-0` so the dataset item identity helpers used by the storage adapters are available at runtime. ([#19384](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/19384))

## 1.15.1

### Patch Changes

- Fixed the ESM build never creating the `mastra_observational_memory` table. The OM schema was loaded through a dynamic `require` that esbuild rewrites to a throwing shim in the ESM output, and the silent catch skipped the table's creation, so `deleteThread()` crashed with Postgres error 42P01 on databases initialized from ESM processes (plain node ESM, tsx, vitest). The schema is now imported statically, which the `@mastra/core` peer dependency range guarantees is available. ([#18957](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18957))

### Patch Changes

- Fixed the ESM build never creating the `mastra_observational_memory` table. The OM schema was loaded through a dynamic `require` that esbuild rewrites to a throwing shim in the ESM output, and the silent catch skipped the table's creation, so `deleteThread()` crashed with Postgres error 42P01 on databases initialized from ESM processes (plain node ESM, tsx, vitest). The schema is now imported statically, which the `@mastra/core` peer dependency range guarantees is available. ([#18957](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18957))

- Updated dependencies [[`4039488`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/403948898af7293198d9e8b3e7fb47f623c78b94), [`b2c9d70`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/b2c9d70757207fb01a9069549e69b6f0d73a6636), [`252f63d`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/252f63d8fec723955adb2202be2f01a75ad0e69c), [`c547a77`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/c547a7729bdf64dfc2df29c965046c0712a18f10), [`81542c1`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/81542c1835c35bc32f2ce4fa9136ee11993cd299), [`cb24ce7`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/cb24ce76bd16ca88eb6a963f6277f8780e703029), [`5f9858f`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/5f9858f791f1137ca7d52d23559fb4568f7a9026)]:

  - @mastra/core@1.50.0-alpha.3

## 1.15.0

### Minor Changes

- Added storage retention support to PostgreSQL. When you set a `retention` config, `PostgresStore` can prune old rows from every growth-table domain it implements: `memory` (threads, messages, resources by `createdAtZ`), `observability` (spans by `startedAtZ`), `scores` (by `createdAtZ`), `workflows` (run snapshots by `updatedAtZ`), `backgroundTasks` (by `completedAtZ`, so in-flight tasks are never pruned), `experiments` (whole runs by `completedAtZ`, results cascade with their parent), `notifications` (by `createdAtZ`), and `schedules` fire history (by `actual_fire_at`). ([#18733](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18733))

  Deletes run in batches via `ctid` subqueries (bounded, resumable, and cancellable) so they stay safe on large tables. Anchor-column indexes are created lazily on the first `prune()` call — never at init — so deployments that don't configure retention pay no extra index overhead. `prune()` only deletes rows; PostgreSQL's autovacuum reclaims the dead tuples for reuse.

  The v-next observability domain (day-partitioned signal event tables: `spans`, `metrics`, `logs`, `scores`, `feedback`) is also covered: `prune()` drops whole day partitions — TimescaleDB chunks via `drop_chunks()`, pg_partman children and native partitions via detach + drop — that are entirely older than the cutoff, so aging out event data is a metadata operation instead of a row-by-row delete.

  ```typescript
  const storage = new PostgresStore({
    id: 'mastra-storage',
    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
    retention: {
      memory: { messages: { maxAge: '30d' } },
      observability: { spans: { maxAge: '7d' } },
    },
  });

  await storage.prune();
  ```

### Patch Changes

- Added optional tenancy arguments to `getDataset`, `updateDataset`, and `deleteDataset`. ([#18750](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18750))

  You can now pass `organizationId` and `projectId` to scope dataset reads, updates, and deletes to a specific tenant. Reads and updates against a dataset in a different tenant throw `DATASET_NOT_FOUND` (surfaced as a 404 over HTTP). Deletes silently no-op on a tenancy mismatch — matching the existing "delete non-existent id is a no-op" semantics so cross-tenant existence is never leaked via error timing or status.

  **Example**

  ```ts
  // Before
  await client.getDataset('abc123');
  await client.deleteDataset('abc123');
  await client.updateDataset({ id: 'abc123', name: 'renamed' });

  // After — scope to a tenant
  await client.getDataset('abc123', { organizationId: 'org_a', projectId: 'proj_1' });
  await client.deleteDataset('abc123', { organizationId: 'org_a' });
  await client.updateDataset({ id: 'abc123', name: 'renamed', organizationId: 'org_a' });
  ```

- Pushed remaining dataset read filters and pagination down to storage. ([#18710](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18710))

  `DatasetsManager.list({ filters })` now accepts `targetType`, `targetIds` (overlap/union semantics), and `name` (substring, case-insensitive) in addition to the existing tenancy and candidate filters. Filtering is pushed down to the storage layer so callers no longer have to post-filter results.

  Storage adapters must also be upgraded to the versions listed below to honor the new filters. If a caller is on this version of `@mastra/core` but on an older storage adapter, the new `targetType`/`targetIds`/`name` filter keys are silently ignored by the adapter — no runtime error, but the filter has no effect and every dataset in the tenancy is returned.

  `Dataset.listItems({ version, search, page, perPage })` now applies `search` and pagination at the storage layer when `version` is provided alongside any of those. Previously they were silently dropped whenever `version` was set. The return shape is unchanged: passing only `version` still returns a bare `DatasetItem[]` snapshot; passing `search`, `page`, or `perPage` (with or without `version`) returns the paginated `{ items, pagination }` shape. The bare-array branch is marked `@deprecated`; prefer passing `page` / `perPage` to always receive the paginated shape.

- Tenancy-scope experiments `getById` and `delete*` on `ExperimentsStorage`. ([#18770](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18770))

  `ExperimentsStorage.getExperimentById`, `getExperimentResultById`, `deleteExperiment`, and `deleteExperimentResults` used to key on the primary id alone, so any caller who knew the id could read or delete the row regardless of tenant. All four now accept an optional `filters: { organizationId?, projectId? }` argument that is enforced on every adapter (inmemory, libsql, pg, mysql, mongodb, spanner):
  - On tenancy mismatch, `get*` returns `null` at the storage layer.
  - On tenancy mismatch, `delete*` is a silent no-op.
  - The tenancy predicate is folded into the destructive DML itself (scoped `WHERE` on the DELETE, an atomic gate + delete inside a transaction, or a scoped subquery for the results cascade). A concurrent tenant swap of the same id between a pre-check and the DELETE cannot let a scoped delete hit another tenant's row.

  Both behaviors match how a missing id already responds, so existence does not leak through error timing or messages.

  The same atomic-DML pattern is also applied to `DatasetsStorage.deleteDataset` across all 5 store adapters, closing a TOCTOU window between the pre-check and the parent DELETE that was introduced when tenancy filters were originally added.

  `Dataset.getExperiment` and the shared experiment-ownership gate on `Dataset` now forward the dataset's tenancy scope to storage, so experiment reads and downstream mutations (list results, update result, delete experiment) reached through a dataset handle are automatically scoped to the owning tenant.

  Legacy calls that omit `filters` are unchanged, so this is fully backwards-compatible.

  ```ts
  // Before: any caller who knew the id could read/delete across tenants.
  await store.experiments.getExperimentById({ id: experimentId });
  await store.experiments.deleteExperiment({ id: experimentId });

  // After: pass the caller's scope; wrong tenant gets null / silent no-op.
  await store.experiments.getExperimentById({
    id: experimentId,
    filters: { organizationId, projectId },
  });
  await store.experiments.deleteExperiment({
    id: experimentId,
    filters: { organizationId, projectId },
  });
  ```

- Fixed a double-encoding bug where `createDataset` and `updateDataset` stored `targetIds` and `scorerIds` as JSON-encoded strings into the `JSONB` columns instead of arrays. This caused the new `listDatasets({ filters: { targetIds } })` overlap query (`targetIds ?| array[...]`) to never match. ([#18710](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18710))

  Existing rows written before this fix are still double-encoded and will not be matched by the new `targetIds` filter. They self-heal on the next `updateDataset` call. Deployments with a long tail of pre-existing datasets should run a one-time backfill (re-encoding `targetIds` and `scorerIds` on affected rows) rather than rely on incidental writes; this can be tracked as a follow-up if needed.

- Fixed a cross-tenant data-access issue on datasets by scoping `DatasetsManager.get` and `DatasetsManager.delete` to tenancy filters. ([#18750](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18750))

  Previously `get({ id })` and `delete({ id })` looked up a dataset by its primary key alone. Any caller who knew a dataset id could read or delete it regardless of which `organizationId` / `projectId` it belonged to. This is now closed at the storage layer via a scoped SQL predicate (option (a) — no fetch-then-assert).

  **What changed**
  - `DatasetsManager.get` and `DatasetsManager.delete` accept optional `organizationId` and `projectId`.
  - The tenancy is stashed on the returned `Dataset` handle and forwarded to every downstream storage call (`getDetails`, `update`, `addItem`, item batch ops, `startExperimentAsync`).
  - The abstract storage contract (`getDatasetById`, `deleteDataset`) gained an optional `filters?: DatasetTenancyFilters` arg.
  - Item-mutation inputs (`AddDatasetItemInput`, `UpdateDatasetItemInput`, `BatchInsertItemsInput`, `BatchDeleteItemsInput`) and `UpdateDatasetInput` accept optional `filters` for the internal existence check.

  **Behavior**
  - Omitting tenancy preserves the existing behavior (no predicate added) — fully backwards compatible.
  - On tenancy mismatch, `get` throws NOT_FOUND (returns null at the storage layer) and `delete` is a silent no-op — matching how a missing id already behaves, so existence does not leak through error timing or messages.

  **Example**

  ```ts
  // Before
  const ds = await mastra.datasets.get({ id });
  await mastra.datasets.delete({ id });

  // After — scope to a tenant
  const ds = await mastra.datasets.get({ id, organizationId, projectId });
  await mastra.datasets.delete({ id, organizationId, projectId });
  ```

- Add optional `batchId`, `datasetId`, and `datasetItemId` fields to persisted scores so saved baseline scores can be grouped as one scoring pass and joined back to the dataset items they came from. ([#18331](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18331))
  - `scoreTrace()` accepts top-level `batchId`, `datasetId`, and `datasetItemId` when persisting a score for a stored trace.
  - `ScoreRowData` and score save payloads now include nullable `batchId`, `datasetId`, and `datasetItemId`.
  - Built-in stores with explicit score schema or attribute mappings now persist these provenance fields on saved scores.
  - D1, DSQL, MSSQL, and Upstash score stores now apply additive provenance migrations or deterministic score ordering for persisted score reads.

  ```ts
  await scoreTrace({
    storage,
    scorer,
    target: { traceId },
    batchId: 'baseline-batch-1',
    datasetId,
    datasetItemId,
  });
  ```

- Added multi-tenant scoping to stored scorer definitions. Stored scorers now persist optional `organizationId` and `projectId` on the definition record, and `list`/`listResolved` accept matching filters to scope results by tenant. The Postgres adapter backfills the new columns and applies the scoped filters; tenancy lives on the record while version snapshots stay pure config. ([#18331](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18331))

  ```ts
  await storage.create({
    scorerDefinition: { id, organizationId: 'org-a', projectId: 'proj-1', ...config },
  });

  const { scorerDefinitions } = await storage.list({
    status: 'draft',
    organizationId: 'org-a',
    projectId: 'proj-1',
  });
  ```

- Added optional `organizationId` and `projectId` fields to scores for multi-tenant isolation. Scores can now be saved with tenancy metadata and the `listScoresBy*` methods accept a `filters` option to scope results by organization and project. ([#18331](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18331))

  ```ts
  await storage.saveScore({ ...score, organizationId: 'org-a', projectId: 'proj-1' });

  const result = await storage.listScoresByScorerId({
    scorerId,
    filters: { organizationId: 'org-a', projectId: 'proj-1' },
  });
  ```

  `projectId` identifies the project scope, separate from `resourceId` which continues to mean the agent memory resource.

- Raise `@mastra/core` peer floor to `>=1.49.0-0` on all storage adapters so the tenancy-related named exports the adapters now consume are guaranteed to exist at install time. ([#18861](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18861))

- Scoped `getDatasetById` and `deleteDataset` to tenancy filters when the caller passes `organizationId` / `projectId`. ([#18750](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18750))

  The adapters now push the tenancy predicate into the SQL/query when the new optional `filters` argument is present. Legacy calls that omit tenancy are unchanged. On mismatch, `getDatasetById` returns `null` and `deleteDataset` is a silent no-op — the cascade delete (dataset items and versions) is gated by a scoped parent pre-check, so cross-tenant data is never touched.

- Added optional `organizationId` and `projectId` query parameters to the dataset routes. ([#18750](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18750))

  `GET /datasets/:datasetId`, `PATCH /datasets/:datasetId`, and `DELETE /datasets/:datasetId` now accept optional tenancy query parameters. When provided, they are forwarded to `mastra.datasets.get` / `.delete` and the operation returns 404 if the dataset does not belong to the requested tenant. Requests that omit the query parameters keep their existing behavior.

  **Example**

  ```
  GET /datasets/abc123?organizationId=org_a&projectId=proj_1

  - @mastra/core@1.49.0

## 1.15.0-alpha.2

### Patch Changes

- Raise `@mastra/core` peer floor to `>=1.49.0-0` on all storage adapters so the tenancy-related named exports the adapters now consume are guaranteed to exist at install time. ([#18861](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18861))

## 1.15.0-alpha.1

### Patch Changes

- Added optional tenancy arguments to `getDataset`, `updateDataset`, and `deleteDataset`. ([#18750](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18750))

  You can now pass `organizationId` and `projectId` to scope dataset reads, updates, and deletes to a specific tenant. Reads and updates against a dataset in a different tenant throw `DATASET_NOT_FOUND` (surfaced as a 404 over HTTP). Deletes silently no-op on a tenancy mismatch — matching the existing "delete non-existent id is a no-op" semantics so cross-tenant existence is never leaked via error timing or status.

  **Example**

  ```ts
  // Before
  await client.getDataset('abc123');
  await client.deleteDataset('abc123');
  await client.updateDataset({ id: 'abc123', name: 'renamed' });

  // After — scope to a tenant
  await client.getDataset('abc123', { organizationId: 'org_a', projectId: 'proj_1' });
  await client.deleteDataset('abc123', { organizationId: 'org_a' });
  await client.updateDataset({ id: 'abc123', name: 'renamed', organizationId: 'org_a' });
  ```

- Pushed remaining dataset read filters and pagination down to storage. ([#18710](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18710))

  `DatasetsManager.list({ filters })` now accepts `targetType`, `targetIds` (overlap/union semantics), and `name` (substring, case-insensitive) in addition to the existing tenancy and candidate filters. Filtering is pushed down to the storage layer so callers no longer have to post-filter results.

  Storage adapters must also be upgraded to the versions listed below to honor the new filters. If a caller is on this version of `@mastra/core` but on an older storage adapter, the new `targetType`/`targetIds`/`name` filter keys are silently ignored by the adapter — no runtime error, but the filter has no effect and every dataset in the tenancy is returned.

  `Dataset.listItems({ version, search, page, perPage })` now applies `search` and pagination at the storage layer when `version` is provided alongside any of those. Previously they were silently dropped whenever `version` was set. The return shape is unchanged: passing only `version` still returns a bare `DatasetItem[]` snapshot; passing `search`, `page`, or `perPage` (with or without `version`) returns the paginated `{ items, pagination }` shape. The bare-array branch is marked `@deprecated`; prefer passing `page` / `perPage` to always receive the paginated shape.

- Tenancy-scope experiments `getById` and `delete*` on `ExperimentsStorage`. ([#18770](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18770))

  `ExperimentsStorage.getExperimentById`, `getExperimentResultById`, `deleteExperiment`, and `deleteExperimentResults` used to key on the primary id alone, so any caller who knew the id could read or delete the row regardless of tenant. All four now accept an optional `filters: { organizationId?, projectId? }` argument that is enforced on every adapter (inmemory, libsql, pg, mysql, mongodb, spanner):
  - On tenancy mismatch, `get*` returns `null` at the storage layer.
  - On tenancy mismatch, `delete*` is a silent no-op.
  - The tenancy predicate is folded into the destructive DML itself (scoped `WHERE` on the DELETE, an atomic gate + delete inside a transaction, or a scoped subquery for the results cascade). A concurrent tenant swap of the same id between a pre-check and the DELETE cannot let a scoped delete hit another tenant's row.

  Both behaviors match how a missing id already responds, so existence does not leak through error timing or messages.

  The same atomic-DML pattern is also applied to `DatasetsStorage.deleteDataset` across all 5 store adapters, closing a TOCTOU window between the pre-check and the parent DELETE that was introduced when tenancy filters were originally added.

  `Dataset.getExperiment` and the shared experiment-ownership gate on `Dataset` now forward the dataset's tenancy scope to storage, so experiment reads and downstream mutations (list results, update result, delete experiment) reached through a dataset handle are automatically scoped to the owning tenant.

  Legacy calls that omit `filters` are unchanged, so this is fully backwards-compatible.

  ```ts
  // Before: any caller who knew the id could read/delete across tenants.
  await store.experiments.getExperimentById({ id: experimentId });
  await store.experiments.deleteExperiment({ id: experimentId });

  // After: pass the caller's scope; wrong tenant gets null / silent no-op.
  await store.experiments.getExperimentById({
    id: experimentId,
    filters: { organizationId, projectId },
  });
  await store.experiments.deleteExperiment({
    id: experimentId,
    filters: { organizationId, projectId },
  });
  ```

- Fixed a double-encoding bug where `createDataset` and `updateDataset` stored `targetIds` and `scorerIds` as JSON-encoded strings into the `JSONB` columns instead of arrays. This caused the new `listDatasets({ filters: { targetIds } })` overlap query (`targetIds ?| array[...]`) to never match. ([#18710](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18710))

  Existing rows written before this fix are still double-encoded and will not be matched by the new `targetIds` filter. They self-heal on the next `updateDataset` call. Deployments with a long tail of pre-existing datasets should run a one-time backfill (re-encoding `targetIds` and `scorerIds` on affected rows) rather than rely on incidental writes; this can be tracked as a follow-up if needed.

- Fixed a cross-tenant data-access issue on datasets by scoping `DatasetsManager.get` and `DatasetsManager.delete` to tenancy filters. ([#18750](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18750))

  Previously `get({ id })` and `delete({ id })` looked up a dataset by its primary key alone. Any caller who knew a dataset id could read or delete it regardless of which `organizationId` / `projectId` it belonged to. This is now closed at the storage layer via a scoped SQL predicate (option (a) — no fetch-then-assert).

  **What changed**
  - `DatasetsManager.get` and `DatasetsManager.delete` accept optional `organizationId` and `projectId`.
  - The tenancy is stashed on the returned `Dataset` handle and forwarded to every downstream storage call (`getDetails`, `update`, `addItem`, item batch ops, `startExperimentAsync`).
  - The abstract storage contract (`getDatasetById`, `deleteDataset`) gained an optional `filters?: DatasetTenancyFilters` arg.
  - Item-mutation inputs (`AddDatasetItemInput`, `UpdateDatasetItemInput`, `BatchInsertItemsInput`, `BatchDeleteItemsInput`) and `UpdateDatasetInput` accept optional `filters` for the internal existence check.

  **Behavior**
  - Omitting tenancy preserves the existing behavior (no predicate added) — fully backwards compatible.
  - On tenancy mismatch, `get` throws NOT_FOUND (returns null at the storage layer) and `delete` is a silent no-op — matching how a missing id already behaves, so existence does not leak through error timing or messages.

  **Example**

  ```ts
  // Before
  const ds = await mastra.datasets.get({ id });
  await mastra.datasets.delete({ id });

  // After — scope to a tenant
  const ds = await mastra.datasets.get({ id, organizationId, projectId });
  await mastra.datasets.delete({ id, organizationId, projectId });
  ```

- Add optional `batchId`, `datasetId`, and `datasetItemId` fields to persisted scores so saved baseline scores can be grouped as one scoring pass and joined back to the dataset items they came from. ([#18331](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18331))
  - `scoreTrace()` accepts top-level `batchId`, `datasetId`, and `datasetItemId` when persisting a score for a stored trace.
  - `ScoreRowData` and score save payloads now include nullable `batchId`, `datasetId`, and `datasetItemId`.
  - Built-in stores with explicit score schema or attribute mappings now persist these provenance fields on saved scores.
  - D1, DSQL, MSSQL, and Upstash score stores now apply additive provenance migrations or deterministic score ordering for persisted score reads.

  ```ts
  await scoreTrace({
    storage,
    scorer,
    target: { traceId },
    batchId: 'baseline-batch-1',
    datasetId,
    datasetItemId,
  });
  ```

- Added multi-tenant scoping to stored scorer definitions. Stored scorers now persist optional `organizationId` and `projectId` on the definition record, and `list`/`listResolved` accept matching filters to scope results by tenant. The Postgres adapter backfills the new columns and applies the scoped filters; tenancy lives on the record while version snapshots stay pure config. ([#18331](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18331))

  ```ts
  await storage.create({
    scorerDefinition: { id, organizationId: 'org-a', projectId: 'proj-1', ...config },
  });

  const { scorerDefinitions } = await storage.list({
    status: 'draft',
    organizationId: 'org-a',
    projectId: 'proj-1',
  });
  ```

- Added optional `organizationId` and `projectId` fields to scores for multi-tenant isolation. Scores can now be saved with tenancy metadata and the `listScoresBy*` methods accept a `filters` option to scope results by organization and project. ([#18331](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18331))

  ```ts
  await storage.saveScore({ ...score, organizationId: 'org-a', projectId: 'proj-1' });

  const result = await storage.listScoresByScorerId({
    scorerId,
    filters: { organizationId: 'org-a', projectId: 'proj-1' },
  });
  ```

  `projectId` identifies the project scope, separate from `resourceId` which continues to mean the agent memory resource.

- Scoped `getDatasetById` and `deleteDataset` to tenancy filters when the caller passes `organizationId` / `projectId`. ([#18750](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18750))

  The adapters now push the tenancy predicate into the SQL/query when the new optional `filters` argument is present. Legacy calls that omit tenancy are unchanged. On mismatch, `getDatasetById` returns `null` and `deleteDataset` is a silent no-op — the cascade delete (dataset items and versions) is gated by a scoped parent pre-check, so cross-tenant data is never touched.

- Added optional `organizationId` and `projectId` query parameters to the dataset routes. ([#18750](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18750))

  `GET /datasets/:datasetId`, `PATCH /datasets/:datasetId`, and `DELETE /datasets/:datasetId` now accept optional tenancy query parameters. When provided, they are forwarded to `mastra.datasets.get` / `.delete` and the operation returns 404 if the dataset does not belong to the requested tenant. Requests that omit the query parameters keep their existing behavior.

  **Example**

  ```
  GET /datasets/abc123?organizationId=org_a&projectId=proj_1
  DELETE /datasets/abc123?organizationId=org_a
  ```

  - @mastra/core@1.49.0-alpha.5

## 1.15.0-alpha.0

### Minor Changes

- Added storage retention support to PostgreSQL. When you set a `retention` config, `PostgresStore` can prune old rows from every growth-table domain it implements: `memory` (threads, messages, resources by `createdAtZ`), `observability` (spans by `startedAtZ`), `scores` (by `createdAtZ`), `workflows` (run snapshots by `updatedAtZ`), `backgroundTasks` (by `completedAtZ`, so in-flight tasks are never pruned), `experiments` (whole runs by `completedAtZ`, results cascade with their parent), `notifications` (by `createdAtZ`), and `schedules` fire history (by `actual_fire_at`). ([#18733](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18733))

  Deletes run in batches via `ctid` subqueries (bounded, resumable, and cancellable) so they stay safe on large tables. Anchor-column indexes are created lazily on the first `prune()` call — never at init — so deployments that don't configure retention pay no extra index overhead. `prune()` only deletes rows; PostgreSQL's autovacuum reclaims the dead tuples for reuse.

  The v-next observability domain (day-partitioned signal event tables: `spans`, `metrics`, `logs`, `scores`, `feedback`) is also covered: `prune()` drops whole day partitions — TimescaleDB chunks via `drop_chunks()`, pg_partman children and native partitions via detach + drop — that are entirely older than the cutoff, so aging out event data is a metadata operation instead of a row-by-row delete.

  ```typescript
  const storage = new PostgresStore({
    id: 'mastra-storage',
    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
    retention: {
      memory: { messages: { maxAge: '30d' } },
      observability: { spans: { maxAge: '7d' } },
    },
  });

  await storage.prune();
  ```

## 1.14.2

### Patch Changes

- Fixed workflow runs advancing their update time when re-persisted in PostgreSQL storage. ([#18004](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18004))

- Fixed PgVector numeric range filters (`$gt`, `$gte`, `$lt`, `$lte`) so rows with non-numeric metadata values no longer fail the whole query. ([#18430](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18430))

  A single document with a value like `{ price: 'N/A' }` used to make the entire query error out, breaking all range-filtered vector queries (and semantic recall using `semanticRecall.filter`) on that index. Rows whose value isn't a number are now skipped for numeric range checks instead, matching the behavior of the other Mastra vector stores. Numeric rows still match as expected.

  ```typescript
  await pgVector.upsert({
    indexName: 'products',
    vectors: [
      [1, 0],
      [0, 1],
    ],
    metadata: [{ price: 100 }, { price: 'N/A' }],
  });

  // Before: threw "invalid input syntax for type numeric: N/A"
  // After: returns only the row whose price is actually a number
  await pgVector.query({
    indexName: 'products',
    queryVector: [1, 0],
    topK: 10,
    filter: { price: { $gt: 50 } },
  });
  ```

- Negated numeric range filters (`$not` with `$gt`, `$gte`, `$lt`, `$lte`) now correctly exclude rows where the filtered field is missing or non-numeric. Previously these rows were incorrectly included in results. ([#18466](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18466))

  - @mastra/core@1.47.0-alpha.2

## 1.14.1

### Patch Changes

- Fixed `PostgresStore.init()` failing with "RoutingDbClient already has a pinned client" when a single store is shared across concurrent requests (for example, request-scoped Mastra instances reusing one store/pool). Concurrent `init()` calls are now coalesced into a single shared initialization instead of each pinning the client. ([#18336](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18336))

  Also, `init()` is now a no-op when `disableInit: true`, so apps that manage their database schema externally are no longer forced through the connect-and-pin path.

- Added multi-tenant scoping columns (`organizationId`, `projectId`) to the experiments domain so experiment records and per-item results inherit the tenancy bucket of their parent dataset. ([#18388](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18388))

  `Experiment`, `ExperimentResult`, `CreateExperimentInput`, and `AddExperimentResultInput` now carry optional `organizationId` / `projectId` fields. `ListExperimentsInput` and `ListExperimentResultsInput` gain a `filters: ExperimentTenancyFilters` block (mirrors `DatasetTenancyFilters`) for scoping queries within a `(organizationId, projectId)` bucket. Tenancy is hydrated from the parent dataset on `createExperiment` and denormalized onto each `ExperimentResult` for efficient tenancy-scoped queries.

  The corresponding columns are also added to the `mastra_experiments` and `mastra_experiment_results` table schemas. Existing rows backfill to `null`, matching the rest of the dataset-tenancy surface.

  This release also clarifies the `targetType` contract via JSDoc:
  - `CreateDatasetInput.targetType` remains optional. Datasets without a `TargetType` are **not experiment-eligible** — the experiment runner requires a non-null `CreateExperimentInput.targetType` to resolve an executor.
  - `Experiment.targetType` / `CreateExperimentInput.targetType` stay required. An experiment by definition replays inputs against a specific target.

  No behavior change for existing OSS-created experiments; the new fields are additive and optional.

  Example:

  ```ts
  // Create an experiment scoped to a tenancy bucket. When the parent dataset
  // already carries `organizationId` / `projectId`, `runExperiment` hydrates
  // these fields automatically from the dataset record.
  const experiment = await storage.createExperiment({
    name: 'qa-regression',
    datasetId: 'ds_123',
    datasetVersion: 1,
    targetType: 'agent',
    targetId: 'agent_qa',
    totalItems: 10,
    organizationId: 'org_123',
    projectId: 'proj_123',
  });

  // List experiments within a tenancy bucket.
  const experiments = await storage.listExperiments({
    pagination: { page: 0, perPage: 20 },
    filters: { organizationId: 'org_123', projectId: 'proj_123' },
  });

  // List per-item results within the same bucket.
  const results = await storage.listExperimentResults({
    experimentId: experiment.id,
    pagination: { page: 0, perPage: 50 },
    filters: { organizationId: 'org_123', projectId: 'proj_123' },
  });
  ```

- Persist and filter dataset tenancy + candidate identity in storage adapters. ([#18314](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18314))

  `createDataset` now persists `organizationId`, `projectId`, `candidateKey`, and `candidateId`. `listDatasets` and `listItems` accept matching tenancy filters.

- Fixed: `mastra build` output no longer hangs on the first storage-touching request when an app uses `LibSQLStore`, `PostgresStore`, or `MySQLStore` with observational memory. `mastra dev` was unaffected; only the bundled `mastra start` output deadlocked. No code changes or `bundler.externals` workaround required on the app side after upgrading. ([#18302](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18302))

- Added storage for item-level tool mocks. Dataset items persist their `toolMocks` and experiment results persist their `toolMockReport`, so mocks and run diagnostics survive across sessions. ([#18036](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18036))

  - @mastra/core@1.46.0

## 1.14.1-alpha.1

### Patch Changes

- Added multi-tenant scoping columns (`organizationId`, `projectId`) to the experiments domain so experiment records and per-item results inherit the tenancy bucket of their parent dataset. ([#18388](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18388))

  `Experiment`, `ExperimentResult`, `CreateExperimentInput`, and `AddExperimentResultInput` now carry optional `organizationId` / `projectId` fields. `ListExperimentsInput` and `ListExperimentResultsInput` gain a `filters: ExperimentTenancyFilters` block (mirrors `DatasetTenancyFilters`) for scoping queries within a `(organizationId, projectId)` bucket. Tenancy is hydrated from the parent dataset on `createExperiment` and denormalized onto each `ExperimentResult` for efficient tenancy-scoped queries.

  The corresponding columns are also added to the `mastra_experiments` and `mastra_experiment_results` table schemas. Existing rows backfill to `null`, matching the rest of the dataset-tenancy surface.

  This release also clarifies the `targetType` contract via JSDoc:
  - `CreateDatasetInput.targetType` remains optional. Datasets without a `TargetType` are **not experiment-eligible** — the experiment runner requires a non-null `CreateExperimentInput.targetType` to resolve an executor.
  - `Experiment.targetType` / `CreateExperimentInput.targetType` stay required. An experiment by definition replays inputs against a specific target.

  No behavior change for existing OSS-created experiments; the new fields are additive and optional.

  Example:

  ```ts
  // Create an experiment scoped to a tenancy bucket. When the parent dataset
  // already carries `organizationId` / `projectId`, `runExperiment` hydrates
  // these fields automatically from the dataset record.
  const experiment = await storage.createExperiment({
    name: 'qa-regression',
    datasetId: 'ds_123',
    datasetVersion: 1,
    targetType: 'agent',
    targetId: 'agent_qa',
    totalItems: 10,
    organizationId: 'org_123',
    projectId: 'proj_123',
  });

  // List experiments within a tenancy bucket.
  const experiments = await storage.listExperiments({
    pagination: { page: 0, perPage: 20 },
    filters: { organizationId: 'org_123', projectId: 'proj_123' },
  });

  // List per-item results within the same bucket.
  const results = await storage.listExperimentResults({
    experimentId: experiment.id,
    pagination: { page: 0, perPage: 50 },
    filters: { organizationId: 'org_123', projectId: 'proj_123' },
  });
  ```

- Persist and filter dataset tenancy + candidate identity in storage adapters. ([#18314](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18314))

  `createDataset` now persists `organizationId`, `projectId`, `candidateKey`, and `candidateId`. `listDatasets` and `listItems` accept matching tenancy filters. Dataset items inherit `organizationId` / `projectId` from their parent dataset on insert, update, delete, and batch insert/delete — items are never settable per call (item tenancy follows dataset tenancy).

  All new columns are nullable and added retroactively via each adapter's existing column-migration path; no breaking DDL. Existing rows continue to read and write fine; new writes can choose to stamp tenancy.

  ```ts
  await storage.createDataset({
    name: 'candidates/missing-tool-call/incident-123',
    organizationId: 'org_abc',
    projectId: 'project_xyz',
    candidateKey: 'missing-tool-call',
    candidateId: 'incident-123',
  });

  await storage.listDatasets({
    pagination: { page: 0, perPage: 20 },
    filters: { organizationId: 'org_abc', projectId: 'project_xyz' },
  });
  ```

## 1.14.1-alpha.0

### Patch Changes

- Fixed `PostgresStore.init()` failing with "RoutingDbClient already has a pinned client" when a single store is shared across concurrent requests (for example, request-scoped Mastra instances reusing one store/pool). Concurrent `init()` calls are now coalesced into a single shared initialization instead of each pinning the client. ([#18336](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18336))

  Also, `init()` is now a no-op when `disableInit: true`, so apps that manage their database schema externally are no longer forced through the connect-and-pin path.

- Fixed: `mastra build` output no longer hangs on the first storage-touching request when an app uses `LibSQLStore`, `PostgresStore`, or `MySQLStore` with observational memory. `mastra dev` was unaffected; only the bundled `mastra start` output deadlocked. No code changes or `bundler.externals` workaround required on the app side after upgrading. ([#18302](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18302))

- Added storage for item-level tool mocks. Dataset items persist their `toolMocks` and experiment results persist their `toolMockReport`, so mocks and run diagnostics survive across sessions. ([#18036](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/18036))

Initialization now reuses a single pooled connection for the duration of startup, so storage initializes reliably with observability enabled. Runtime queries are unaffected. Fixes #17679. ([#17833](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/17833))

- Fixed skill updates creating duplicate versions when a snapshot had not meaningfully changed. Comparison previously relied on `JSON.stringify`, so reordered object keys (common with PostgreSQL JSONB) or optional fields round-tripping between `undefined` and `null` looked like changes. Skill snapshots are now compared by value, so repeated no-op publish/update cycles no longer increment the version number. ([#16811](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/16811))

- Updated dependencies [[`de66bb0`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/de66bb040570444c702ce4d8e1e228a5de2949cb), [`67bf8e2`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/67bf8e206dfe583954d96015cf0d09f7ac50e45f), [`8216d05`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/8216d0528d866eb9a07f5d4c87ea3bb1e1139b45), [`d18b23c`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/d18b23c5e29dfc381e73e3c51fcf6c779afd1823), [`5eb94eb`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/5eb94ebcf66d4e28c9e26d5821ac93379bab20a0), [`1fa3e12`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/1fa3e123582b63cfe49de4ee52dc6a065e8d956a), [`f9ee2ac`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/f9ee2ac661af584e61bc063ac208c9035cd752ef), [`c853d53`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/c853d535d2df84ab89db1adb4c28900c54c9a2d2), [`d8df1f8`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/d8df1f8e947e1966c9d4e54713df56d0d0d65226), [`9192ddb`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/9192ddbced8949113b30de444cbe763f075b59f5), [`ae96523`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/ae965231f562d9766b0c90c49a69fc68acaa031c), [`17d5a92`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/17d5a9211aa293b4d4418de3de70dc0394d58101), [`5573693`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/5573693b589822250e20dfe6cf66e9ff3bc96da8), [`ec4da8a`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/ec4da8a09e0d2ab452c6ee2c786042ea826b77e5), [`adc44e1`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/adc44e13c7e570b91e86b20ea7556e61d819db31), [`ed346c0`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/ed346c0bee2d8496690a4e538bfba1e46894660f), [`c9ce1b2`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/c9ce1b28d10871110648f9d7b6d76e880b9fa999), [`3ef01fd`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/3ef01fd130b53d5bd4f828beb174e516a2eb1158), [`245a9a3`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/245a9a315705fce17ddd980f78a92504b6615c4a), [`dc0b611`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/dc0b6119b769bd00ee2c5df9259fb376fe63077a), [`38b5de8`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/38b5de8e5d1d41a69522addf53d96f4b3a1d5bf0), [`dc0b611`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/dc0b6119b769bd00ee2c5df9259fb376fe63077a), [`dd6a66e`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/dd6a66ea0b32e0dea8059aec6b35d151e2c87dc4), [`d785c59`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/d785c593b67fcb4cdc4fab9fdbde5f3b7665efc0), [`1fa3e12`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/1fa3e123582b63cfe49de4ee52dc6a065e8d956a), [`8b984f4`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/8b984f4361c202270ceb69257185c4756c9a7c56), [`bf08402`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/bf084022374fa5d06ca70ed67a86dd64e379071b), [`81fe587`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/81fe587275035715c1720ddf3fee0505cf053036), [`1fa3e12`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/1fa3e123582b63cfe49de4ee52dc6a065e8d956a), [`403c438`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/403c438e417278989ce247233d2c465b8d902cdd), [`f8ba195`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/f8ba1954e27ee2b20586cc6cd9cf13c002c232f2)]:
  - @mastra/core@1.43.0

## 1.13.0

### Minor Changes

- Add the v-next observability storage domain for `@mastra/pg`, an insert-only, ([#16760](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/16760))
  partitioned Postgres adapter for low-volume observability (~100 calls/sec,
  up to roughly 1,500 calls/sec sustained on a single primary).

  The new `PostgresStoreVNext` composes a primary `PostgresStore` (memory,
  workflows, scores, agents, etc.) with an `ObservabilityStoragePostgresVNext`
  for spans, logs, metrics, scores, and feedback. All observability writes go
  through a single multi-row `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` path. Storage
  is partitioned per day with three modes auto-detected at `init()` time:
  TimescaleDB hypertables, pg_partman (4.x or 5.x), or native Postgres range
  partitions. Root-span lookups are served by partial indexes, and OLAP queries
  (aggregates, breakdowns, time-series, percentiles) prune partitions by
  `timestamp`. A small discovery cache table powers stale-while-revalidate
  lookups for entity names/types/labels.

  The `observability` connection is **required** — callers always make an
  explicit decision about where observability data lives. For production,
  point it at a dedicated Postgres instance to keep OLAP scans from
  contending with your primary OLTP workload. Reusing the primary
  connection works for local development and logs a runtime warning on every
  construction.

  ```typescript
  import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core';
  import { PostgresStoreVNext } from '@mastra/pg';

  export const mastra = new Mastra({
    storage: new PostgresStoreVNext({
      id: 'app',
      connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL!,
      observability: {
        connectionString: process.env.OBSERVABILITY_DATABASE_URL!,
      },
    }),
  });
  ```

  Delta polling uses Postgres transaction IDs and a safe transaction horizon so
  concurrent writers cannot cause late-committing rows to be skipped. The
  `observability-delta-polling` feature flag is opt-in.

  `ensureNativePartitions()` swallows the `42P07 relation already exists`
  error around `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS … PARTITION OF`, matching the
  existing guard used for base-table and index DDL. This makes concurrent
  `init()` from two processes (serverless cold-start, blue/green overlap, two
  stores sharing a schema) idempotent instead of letting the loser surface an
  unhandled duplicate-relation error.

### Patch Changes

- dependencies updates: ([#17148](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/17148))
  - Updated dependency [`pg@^8.21.0` ↗︎](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg/v/8.21.0) (from `^8.20.0`, in `dependencies`)

- Added full Agent Builder storage support to the PostgreSQL adapter, bringing it to parity with libSQL. ([#17596](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/17596))

  Previously, projects using PostgreSQL could not store tool provider connections or agent tool providers, and several Agent Builder tables were missing from the exported schema.
  - Added storage for tool provider connections, so connections can be created, read, listed by author, and deleted on PostgreSQL.
  - Agent versions now persist their tool providers on PostgreSQL across save and load.
  - Fixed schema export so all Agent Builder tables are included.

- Fixed `PgVector` ignoring an explicit `ssl` option when the connection string also contained an `sslmode=` (or `ssl=`) query parameter. `node-postgres` re-parses the connection string and overwrote the explicit `ssl` object, causing `UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY` / "self-signed certificate" errors against self-signed or internal CAs even when verification was meant to be skipped. ([#17650](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/17650))

  `PgVector` now honors an explicit `ssl` option over the connection string, matching the existing `PostgresStore` behavior. Connection-string-only SSL (`?sslmode=require` with no explicit `ssl`) keeps working as before.

  ```ts
  import { PgVector } from '@mastra/pg';

  // This now connects instead of throwing UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY
  const vector = new PgVector({
    id: 'my-vector',
    connectionString: 'postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db?sslmode=require',
    ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false },
  });
  ```

      },
    }),
  });
  ```

  Delta polling uses Postgres transaction IDs and a safe transaction horizon so
  concurrent writers cannot cause late-committing rows to be skipped. The
  `observability-delta-polling` feature flag is opt-in.

  `ensureNativePartitions()` swallows the `42P07 relation already exists`
  error around `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS … PARTITION OF`, matching the
  existing guard used for base-table and index DDL. This makes concurrent
  `init()` from two processes (serverless cold-start, blue/green overlap, two
  stores sharing a schema) idempotent instead of letting the loser surface an
  unhandled duplicate-relation error.

### Patch Changes

- Added full Agent Builder storage support to the PostgreSQL adapter, bringing it to parity with libSQL. ([#17596](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/17596))

  Previously, projects using PostgreSQL could not store tool provider connections or agent tool providers, and several Agent Builder tables were missing from the exported schema.
  - Added storage for tool provider connections, so connections can be created, read, listed by author, and deleted on PostgreSQL.
  - Agent versions now persist their tool providers on PostgreSQL across save and load.
  - Fixed schema export so all Agent Builder tables are included.

### Patch Changes

- Added notification inbox storage support for Postgres stores. ([#17241](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/17241))

  ```ts
  import { PostgresStore } from '@mastra/pg';

  const storage = new PostgresStore({ connectionString: process.env.POSTGRES_URL! });
  ```

  Agents using this store can persist thread-scoped notification inbox records for notification signals.

## 1.12.0

### Minor Changes

- Added the `disableInit` option to the `MastraVector` base class. When set to `true`, vector stores skip creating schemas, extensions, tables, and indexes at application startup. This matches the existing `disableInit` behavior on storage adapters and is useful for deployments where schemas and indexes are created ahead of time by a privileged database role, while the application runs with a least-privilege role. ([#17272](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/17272))

  **Usage**

  ```typescript
  const vector = new PgVector({
    id: 'vectors',
    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
    disableInit: true,
  });
  ```

  The `MASTRA_DISABLE_STORAGE_INIT` environment variable also disables vector init, so a single flag prevents both storage and vector stores from creating schemas, tables, or indexes at startup.

### Patch Changes

- Fixed `PostgresStore` ignoring an explicit `ssl` option when the `connectionString` also carries an `sslmode=`/`ssl=` query param. node-postgres re-parses the connection string and `Object.assign`s the URL-derived `ssl` over the explicit one, so a config like `{ connectionString: '...?sslmode=require', ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false } }` silently dropped `rejectUnauthorized: false` and failed with `UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY` against self-signed CAs. The connection-string branch now parses the URL and applies the explicit `ssl` last, while still honoring URL-driven SSL when no `ssl` option is provided. Fixes #17307. ([#17356](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/17356))

  - @mastra/core@1.38.0-alpha.3

## 1.11.1

### Patch Changes

- Fixed scheduler performance and correctness issues that could cause excessive Postgres CPU and noisy failed runs. ([#16805](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/16805))
  - Added missing indexes on the schedules tables that the tick loop polls every 10 seconds: `(status, next_fire_at)` on `mastra_schedules` and `(schedule_id, actual_fire_at)` on `mastra_schedule_triggers`. Without these the scheduler performed a full sequential scan on every tick.
  - The scheduler tick loop is now only started when at least one workflow declares a schedule (or `scheduler.enabled` is set explicitly), so deployments without scheduled workflows no longer poll the database at all.
  - The scheduler now validates that a schedule's target workflow is still registered before firing it. Schedules whose target workflow has been removed from the Mastra config are skipped for a short grace window and then deleted, so stale rows stop producing failed workflow runs forever.
  - The scheduler is now lazily initialized inside `startWorkers()`. Accessing `mastra.scheduler` before `startWorkers()` runs throws a descriptive error instead of returning a half-initialized instance.

- Updated dependencies [[`452036a`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/452036a0d965b4f4c1efd93606e4f03b50b807a5), [`c272d50`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/c272d50610a54496b6b6d92ccd4d37b333a2613a), [`27fd1b7`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/27fd1b79ac62eb7694f92587eb7d1be05b59be01), [`5ba7253`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/5ba7253745c85e8df8012a76d954c640ffa336f7), [`5556cc1`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/5556cc1befec71518d84f826b3bfe3a079a9daf7), [`f73980d`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/f73980d651eb5f7f1ab20582de4615a1b6f10fce), [`5499303`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/54993032c1ebc09642625b78d2014e0cf84a3cae), [`a702009`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/a702009d3cfaa745120f501e21c783ed4d6a3072), [`9aee493`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/9aee493ed6089b5133472623dcce49934bf2d509), [`d8692af`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/d8692afa253028e39cdce2aafa0ac414071a762e), [`1a9cc60`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/1a9cc6069f9910fc3d59e4953ac8cd95d89ad6f5), [`8cdb86c`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/8cdb86ceed1137bc2768e147dce85a0692b9fb26), [`8534d79`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/8534d791fa1cb70fe1c19e2604c4b63cc10dd051), [`eda90c5`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/eda90c5bfd7de11805ecc9f4552716c895fbaf78), [`a935b0a`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/a935b0a0977ae3f196b33ec7621f528069c82db0), [`9c88701`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/9c8870195b41a38dc40b6ba2aa55eda04df8fa69), [`c78f8cd`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/c78f8cd6222a86e6c60ae5210b6929ad5221b6fb), [`e146aad`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/e146aadbba66c410ba0e74bac4c50135495cb8dd), [`ac79462`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/ac79462b98f1062394c45093aa515b0766f27ee2), [`1a0ec78`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/1a0ec789a26cae443744e9abbd62ed6ee676af39), [`e47bca7`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/e47bca7b72866d3abd173b9f530ac4318113a8ff), [`afc004f`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/afc004f5cc7e30697809e7021820b9f5881e6719), [`0031d0f`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/0031d0f13831d7843ac5d498734a7d92862e2ce3), [`841a222`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/841a222560d8c19238f8213713f30535cdd82284), [`64c1e0b`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/64c1e0b35165c96b659818bd0177aa18794ef11f), [`40d83a9`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/40d83a90d9be31a1b83e04649edb703eb7753e33), [`4e88dc6`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/4e88dc6b89f154c0eae37221c8126be0c23c569f), [`19018f0`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/19018f05722af74a5978781a7731a654b26f7f2a), [`19281c7`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/19281c70424f757219782de16c2699743c5e04d0), [`3498b49`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/3498b4946be94f4313cd817733589680dcda5278), [`d52b6fe`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/d52b6fe1c56853eb38864baae0bbfa75cc739ccb), [`408be73`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/408be73449dfab92b51eab8c6623b6c443debc25), [`359439b`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/359439bb8c635e048176306828195f8297f50021), [`71a820b`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/71a820b2353fa1406772c50760a3732058a8b337), [`1698f5e`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/1698f5ec141d34f22a873efdb145ce3cdf848a5e)]:

  - @mastra/core@1.36.0-alpha.10

## 1.11.0

### Minor Changes

- Added favorites support to storage adapters so callers can favorite/unfavorite stored agents and skills, query favorite state alongside list results, and filter listings by visibility. ([#16580](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/16580))

  **Example**

  ```ts
  const storage = new LibSQLStore({/* config */});
  const favorites = await storage.getStore('favorites');

  await favorites?.favorite({
    userId: 'user-1',
    entityType: 'agent',
    entityId: 'agent-42',
  });
  ```

### Patch Changes

- Fixed a workspace PATCH bug: omitted config fields in a PATCH no longer overwrite previously-persisted values with `undefined`. ([#16580](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/16580))

- Bumped `@mastra/core` peer dependency floor to `>=1.34.0-0` so the new `@mastra/core/storage/domains/favorites` subpath is available. Older `@mastra/core` versions don't ship the `FavoritesStorage` base class these adapters now extend. ([#16580](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/16580))

- Updated dependencies [[`b661349`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/b661349281514691db78941a9044e6e4f1cde7a7), [`816b974`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/816b974b424e4a1bfae3af30cc41263b6f1c0344), [`271c044`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/271c044f6b79ff38cfa3409f4385fbd26a0f3185), [`bad08e9`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/bad08e99c5291884c3ac76743c78c74f53a302c2), [`816b974`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/816b974b424e4a1bfae3af30cc41263b6f1c0344), [`b32ba5f`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/b32ba5fde524b46a4ff1bdf38e30d62a2bb29b04), [`75c7c38`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/75c7c38a4e9af9821931539dd339f57fcc6414e3)]:

## 1.10.1

### Patch Changes

- Fixed `@mastra/pg` listing endpoints (agents, MCP clients, MCP servers, prompt blocks, scorer definitions, skills, and workspaces) so a single row with a malformed value no longer returns HTTP 500 and hides every other record in the Mastra Editor. Listings now tolerate the bad row and return the rest. ([#16233](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/16233))

  Fixes #16224.

- Respect optional `resourceId` in `getThreadById` so scoped thread lookups return `null` when the thread belongs to a different resource. ([#14237](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/14237))

  Example:

  ```typescript
  const thread = await memory.getThreadById({
    threadId: 'my-thread-id',
    resourceId: 'my-user-id',
  });
  // Returns null if the thread does not belong to 'my-user-id'.
  ```

- Track `suspendedAt` and `suspendPayload` on background tasks. SQL adapters auto-migrate the new columns via `alterTable`. ([#16260](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/16260))

  - @mastra/core@1.33.0

## 1.10.1-alpha.2

### Patch Changes

- Fixed `@mastra/pg` listing endpoints (agents, MCP clients, MCP servers, prompt blocks, scorer definitions, skills, and workspaces) so a single row with a malformed value no longer returns HTTP 500 and hides every other record in the Mastra Editor. Listings now tolerate the bad row and return the rest. ([#16233](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/16233))

  Fixes #16224.

- Updated dependencies [[`cc189cc`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/cc189cc0128eb7af233476b5e421ec6888bffde7)]:
  - @mastra/core@1.33.0-alpha.16

## 1.10.1-alpha.1

### Patch Changes

- Respect optional `resourceId` in `getThreadById` so scoped thread lookups return `null` when the thread belongs to a different resource. ([#14237](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/14237))

  Example:

  ```typescript
  const thread = await memory.getThreadById({
    threadId: 'my-thread-id',
    resourceId: 'my-user-id',
  });
  // Returns null if the thread does not belong to 'my-user-id'.
  ```

  - @mastra/core@1.33.0-alpha.4

## 1.10.0

### Minor Changes

- Extend the schedules storage schema to support owned schedules and richer trigger audit. This is a breaking schema change to `mastra_schedules` and `mastra_schedule_triggers`; scheduled workflows are still in alpha so no compat shim is provided. ([#16166](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/16166))
  - `Schedule` gains optional `ownerType` / `ownerId` so a schedule row can be attributed to an owning subsystem (e.g. an agent that owns a heartbeat schedule). Workflow schedules leave both fields unset.
  - `ScheduleTrigger.status` is renamed to `outcome` and the type is widened to `ScheduleTriggerOutcome` so future outcome values can be added without another rename.
  - `ScheduleTrigger` gains a stable `id` primary key and new `triggerKind`, `parentTriggerId`, and `metadata` fields. `triggerKind` distinguishes `schedule-fire` rows from later `queue-drain` rows (used by upcoming heartbeat work); `parentTriggerId` links related rows; `metadata` carries outcome-specific context.
  - The libsql, pg, and mongodb adapters all add the new columns/indexes. Their `@mastra/core` peer dependency is tightened to `>=1.32.0-0 <2.0.0-0` so installing a new storage adapter against an older core (or vice-versa) surfaces a peer-dependency warning at install time instead of silently writing/reading the wrong field.
  - Scheduler producer, server schemas/handler, and client SDK types are updated to use the new fields. The `triggers` response on `GET /api/schedules/:id/triggers` now returns `outcome` instead of `status`.
  - The bundled Studio (Mastra CLI) is updated to read `outcome` so the schedule detail page keeps polling and rendering publish-failure rows correctly.

- Added the `schedules` storage domain so Postgres-backed Mastra apps can use scheduled workflows. Creates `mastra_schedules` and `mastra_schedule_triggers` tables on init, with default indexes on `(status, next_fire_at)` for due-schedule polling and `(schedule_id, actual_fire_at)` for trigger-history queries.

### Patch Changes

- Fixed workflow snapshot sanitization in `@mastra/pg` for strings containing escaped surrogate patterns like `[^\ud800-\udfff]`. This prevents invalid JSON escape sequences that caused PostgreSQL `jsonb` writes to fail with error `22P02`. ([#15923](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/15923))

  Fixes #15920

### Patch Changes

- Fixed workflow snapshot sanitization in `@mastra/pg` for strings containing escaped surrogate patterns like `[^\ud800-\udfff]`. This prevents invalid JSON escape sequences that caused PostgreSQL `jsonb` writes to fail with error `22P02`. ([#15923](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/15923))

## 1.9.3

### Patch Changes

- Fixed auto-migration for the `mastra_observational_memory` table to include the `reflectedObservationLineCount` column. Previously, upgrading from older versions would crash on `Memory.cloneThread()` because this column was missing from the `ifNotExists` migration list.

## 1.9.1

### Patch Changes

- Fixed vector similarity queries to leverage HNSW and IVFFlat indexes. When querying without filters on an HNSW or IVFFlat-indexed table, ORDER BY and LIMIT are now placed inside the CTE so PostgreSQL can use the index for faster approximate nearest neighbor searches instead of scanning all rows. ([#14574](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/14574))

- Fixed `batchInsert` and `batchUpdate` in `@mastra/pg` to run on a single Postgres transaction connection. ([#15312](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/15312))

  This prevents pooled `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` calls from landing on different connections and leaving idle transactions open during batch writes.

- Fixed "column does not exist" errors when using experiment review features on databases created before the review pipeline was introduced. Startup now automatically migrates older experiment tables to the latest schema. ([#15304](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/15304))

- Fixed vector operations failing when pgvector extension is installed in a custom schema. The search_path is now set before index creation and vector similarity queries, ensuring operator classes (e.g. vector_cosine_ops) and distance operators (e.g. <=>) resolve correctly regardless of where the extension is installed. Previously, only table creation set the search_path, causing CREATE INDEX and query operations to fail with unresolvable operator errors. ([#14526](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/14526))

- Added `entityVersionId`, `parentEntityVersionId`, and `rootEntityVersionId` columns to observability storage tables (spans, metrics, scores, feedback, logs) for filtering and grouping traces by entity version. Added ALTER TABLE migrations for existing databases. Added `targetType`, `targetId`, `agentVersion`, and `status` filters to `listExperiments`, and `traceId` and `status` filters to `listExperimentResults`.

  - @mastra/core@1.25.0-alpha.3

## 1.9.1-alpha.0

### Patch Changes

- Fixed `batchInsert` and `batchUpdate` in `@mastra/pg` to run on a single Postgres transaction connection. ([#15312](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/15312))

  This prevents pooled `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` calls from landing on different connections and leaving idle transactions open during batch writes.

- Fixed "column does not exist" errors when using experiment review features on databases created before the review pipeline was introduced. Startup now automatically migrates older experiment tables to the latest schema. ([#15304](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/15304))

## 1.9.0

### Minor Changes

- Implemented `updateObservationalMemoryConfig()` in Postgres, LibSQL, and MongoDB storage adapters. This enables per-record config overrides for observational memory thresholds, supporting the new `memory.updateObservationalMemoryConfig()` API in `@mastra/memory`. ([#15115](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/15115))

### Patch Changes

- Fixed observational memory date-range queries to use ISO-string timestamp columns (`createdAtZ`) instead of the raw `createdAt` column, ensuring correct filtering when querying observations by date range. ([#15115](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/15115))

## 1.8.5

### Patch Changes

- Fixed thread and message timestamp handling to use timezone-aware columns (TIMESTAMPTZ) for sorting and date range filtering. Previously, ORDER BY and date range queries used TIMESTAMP columns which could produce incorrect ordering when the PostgreSQL server timezone differs from UTC. Also fixed timestamp values passed to UPDATE queries to use Date objects instead of ISO strings, preventing timezone information from being stripped when stored in TIMESTAMP columns.

## 1.8.4

### Patch Changes

- The internal architecture of observational memory has been refactored. The public API and behavior remain unchanged. ([#14453](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/14453))

- Add `getReviewSummary()` to experiments storage for aggregating review status counts ([#14649](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/14649))

  Query experiment results grouped by experiment ID, returning counts of `needs-review`, `reviewed`, and `complete` items in a single query instead of fetching all results client-side.

  ```ts
  const summary = await storage.experiments.getReviewSummary();
  // [{ experimentId: 'exp-1', needsReview: 3, reviewed: 5, complete: 2, total: 10 }, ...]
  ```

- Added `scorerIds` persistence for datasets. The `scorerIds` field is now stored and retrieved correctly when creating or updating datasets. ([#14783](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/14783))

- Add `getReviewSummary()` to experiments storage for aggregating review status counts ([#14649](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/14649))

  Query experiment results grouped by experiment ID, returning counts of `needs-review`, `reviewed`, and `complete` items in a single query instead of fetching all results client-side.

  ```ts
  const summary = await storage.experiments.getReviewSummary();
  // [{ experimentId: 'exp-1', needsReview: 3, reviewed: 5, complete: 2, total: 10 }, ...]
  ```

### Patch Changes

- **Refactored Observational Memory into modular architecture** ([#14453](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/14453))

  Restructured the Observational Memory (OM) engine from a single ~3,800-line monolithic class into a modular, strategy-based architecture. The public API and behavior are unchanged — this is a purely internal refactor that improves maintainability, testability, and separation of concerns.

  **Why** — The original `ObservationalMemory` class handled everything: orchestration, LLM calling, observation logic for three different scopes, reflection, buffering coordination, turn lifecycle, and message processing. This made it difficult to reason about individual behaviors, test them in isolation, or extend the system. The refactor separates these responsibilities into focused modules.

  **Observation strategies** — Extracted three duplicated observation code paths (~650 lines of conditionals) into pluggable strategy classes sharing a common `prepare → process → persist` lifecycle via an abstract base class. The correct strategy is selected automatically based on scope and buffering configuration.

  ```
  observation-strategies/
    base.ts            — abstract ObservationStrategy + StrategyDeps interface
    sync.ts            — SyncObservationStrategy (thread-scoped synchronous)
    async-buffer.ts    — AsyncBufferObservationStrategy (background buffered)
    resource-scoped.ts — ResourceScopedObservationStrategy (multi-thread)
    index.ts           — static factory: ObservationStrategy.create(om, opts)
  ```

  ```ts
  // Internal usage — strategies are selected and run automatically:
  const strategy = ObservationStrategy.create(om, {
    record,
    threadId,
    resourceId,
    messages,
    cycleId,
    startedAt,
  });
  const result = await strategy.run();
  ```

  **Turn/Step abstraction** — Introduced `ObservationTurn` and `StepContext` to model the lifecycle of a single agent interaction. A Turn manages message loading, system message injection, record caching, and cleanup. A Step handles per-generation observation, activation, and reflection decisions. This replaced ~580 lines of inline orchestration in the processor with ~170 lines of structured calls.

  ```ts
  // Internal lifecycle managed by the processor:
  const turn = new ObservationTurn(om, memory, { threadId, resourceId });
  await turn.start(messageList, writer); // loads history, injects OM system message

  const step = turn.step(0);
  await step.prepare(messageList, writer); // activate buffered, maybe reflect
  // ... agent generates response ...
  await step.complete(messageList, writer); // observe new messages, buffer if needed

  await turn.end(messageList, writer); // persist, cleanup
  ```

  **Dedicated runners** — Moved observer and reflector LLM-calling logic into `ObserverRunner` (194 lines) and `ReflectorRunner` (710 lines), separating prompt construction, degenerate output detection, retry logic, and compression level escalation from orchestration. `BufferingCoordinator` (175 lines) extracts the static buffering state machine and async operation tracking.

  **Processor** — Added `ObservationalMemoryProcessor` implementing the `Processor` interface, bridging the OM engine with the AI SDK message pipeline. It owns the decision of _when_ to buffer, activate, observe, and reflect — while the OM engine owns _how_ to do each operation.

  ```ts
  // The processor is created automatically by Memory when OM is enabled.
  // It plugs into the AI SDK message pipeline:
  const memory = new Memory({
    storage: new InMemoryStore(),
    options: {
      observationalMemory: {
        enabled: true,
        observation: { model, messageTokens: 500 },
        reflection: { model, observationTokens: 10_000 },
      },
    },
  });

  // For direct access to the OM engine (e.g. for manual observe/buffer/activate):
  const om = await memory.omEngine;
  ```

  **Unified OM engine instantiation** — Replaced the duplicated `getOMEngine()` singleton and per-call `createOMProcessor()` engine creation with a single lazy `omEngine` property on the `Memory` class. This eliminates config drift between the legacy `getContext()` API and the processor pipeline — both now share the same `ObservationalMemory` instance with the full configuration.

  ```ts
  // Before (casting required, config could drift):
  const om = (await (memory as any).getOMEngine()) as ObservationalMemory;

  // After (typed, single shared engine):
  const om = await memory.omEngine;
  ```

  **Improved observation activation atomicity** — Added conditional WHERE clauses to `activateBufferedObservations` in all storage adapters (pg, libsql, mongodb) to prevent duplicate chunk swaps when concurrent processes attempt activation simultaneously. If chunks have already been cleared by another process, the operation returns early with zero counts instead of corrupting state.

  **Compression start level from model context** — Integrated model-aware compression start levels into the `ReflectorRunner`. Models like `gemini-2.5-flash` that struggle with light compression now start at compression level 2 instead of 1, reducing wasted reflection retries.

  **Pure function extraction** — Moved reusable helpers into `message-utils.ts`: `filterObservedMessages`, `getBufferedChunks`, `sortThreadsByOldestMessage`, `stripThreadTags`. Eliminated dead code including `isObserving` DB flag, `countMessageTokens`, `acquireObservingLock`/`releaseObservingLock`, and ~10 cascading dead private methods.

  **Cleanup** — Dropped `threadIdCache` (pointless memoization), removed `as any` casts for private method access (made methods properly public with `@internal` tsdoc), replaced sealed-ID-based tracking with message-level `metadata.mastra.sealed` flag checks.

### Patch Changes

- Added storage support for dataset targeting and experiment status fields. ([#14470](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/14470))
  - Added `targetType` (text) and `targetIds` (jsonb) columns to datasets table for entity association
  - Added `tags` (jsonb) column to datasets table for tag vocabulary

## 1.8.0

### Minor Changes

- Added `metadataIndexes` option to `createIndex()` for PgVector. This allows creating btree indexes on specific metadata fields in vector tables, significantly improving query performance when filtering by those fields. This is especially impactful for Memory's `memory_messages` table, which filters by `thread_id` and `resource_id` — previously causing sequential scans under load. ([#14034](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/14034))

  **Usage example:**

  ```ts
  await pgVector.createIndex({
    indexName: 'my_vectors',
    dimension: 1536,
    metadataIndexes: ['thread_id', 'resource_id'],
  });
  ```

  Fixes #12109

- Add support for pgvector's `bit` and `sparsevec` vector storage types ([#12815](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/12815))

  You can now store binary and sparse vectors in `@mastra/pg`:

  ```ts
  // Binary vectors for fast similarity search
  await db.createIndex({
    indexName: 'my_binary_index',
    dimension: 128,
    metric: 'hamming', // or 'jaccard'
    vectorType: 'bit',
  });

  // Sparse vectors for BM25/TF-IDF representations
  await db.createIndex({
    indexName: 'my_sparse_index',
    dimension: 500,
    metric: 'cosine',
    vectorType: 'sparsevec',
  });
  ```

  What's new:
  - `vectorType: 'bit'` for binary vectors with `'hamming'` and `'jaccard'` distance metrics
  - `vectorType: 'sparsevec'` for sparse vectors (cosine, euclidean, dotproduct)
  - Automatic metric normalization: `bit` defaults to `'hamming'` when no metric is specified
  - `includeVector` round-trips work correctly for all vector types
  - Requires pgvector >= 0.7.0

- Added `requestContext` column to the spans table. Request context data from tracing is now persisted alongside other span data. ([#14020](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/14020))

- Added `requestContext` and `requestContextSchema` column support to dataset storage. Dataset items now persist request context alongside input and ground truth data. ([#13938](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/13938))

### Patch Changes

- Added resilient column handling to insert and update operations. Unknown columns in records are now silently dropped instead of causing SQL errors, ensuring forward compatibility when newer domain packages add fields that haven't been migrated yet. ([#14021](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/14021))

  For example, calling `db.insert({ tableName, record: { id: '1', title: 'Hello', futureField: 'value' } })` will silently ignore `futureField` if it doesn't exist in the database table, rather than throwing.

  - @mastra/core@1.11.0

## 1.8.0-alpha.0

### Minor Changes

- Added `metadataIndexes` option to `createIndex()` for PgVector. This allows creating btree indexes on specific metadata fields in vector tables, significantly improving query performance when filtering by those fields. This is especially impactful for Memory's `memory_messages` table, which filters by `thread_id` and `resource_id` — previously causing sequential scans under load. ([#14034](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/14034))

  **Usage example:**

  ```ts
  await pgVector.createIndex({
    indexName: 'my_vectors',
    dimension: 1536,
    metadataIndexes: ['thread_id', 'resource_id'],
  });
  ```

  Fixes #12109

- Add support for pgvector's `bit` and `sparsevec` vector storage types ([#12815](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/12815))

  You can now store binary and sparse vectors in `@mastra/pg`:

  ```ts
  // Binary vectors for fast similarity search
  await db.createIndex({
    indexName: 'my_binary_index',
    dimension: 128,
    metric: 'hamming', // or 'jaccard'
    vectorType: 'bit',
  });

  // Sparse vectors for BM25/TF-IDF representations
  await db.createIndex({
    indexName: 'my_sparse_index',
    dimension: 500,
    metric: 'cosine',
    vectorType: 'sparsevec',
  });
  ```

  What's new:
  - `vectorType: 'bit'` for binary vectors with `'hamming'` and `'jaccard'` distance metrics
  - `vectorType: 'sparsevec'` for sparse vectors (cosine, euclidean, dotproduct)
  - Automatic metric normalization: `bit` defaults to `'hamming'` when no metric is specified
  - `includeVector` round-trips work correctly for all vector types
  - Requires pgvector >= 0.7.0

- Added `requestContext` column to the spans table. Request context data from tracing is now persisted alongside other span data. ([#14020](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/14020))

- Added `requestContext` and `requestContextSchema` column support to dataset storage. Dataset items now persist request context alongside input and ground truth data. ([#13938](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/13938))

### Patch Changes

- Added resilient column handling to insert and update operations. Unknown columns in records are now silently dropped instead of causing SQL errors, ensuring forward compatibility when newer domain packages add fields that haven't been migrated yet. ([#14021](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/14021))

  For example, calling `db.insert({ tableName, record: { id: '1', title: 'Hello', futureField: 'value' } })` will silently ignore `futureField` if it doesn't exist in the database table, rather than throwing. The same applies to `update` — unknown fields in the data payload are dropped before building the SQL statement.

- Fixed slow semantic recall in the Postgres storage adapter for large threads. Recall now completes in under 500ms even for threads with 7,000+ messages, down from ~30 seconds. (Fixes #11702) ([#14022](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/14022))

## 1.7.0

### Minor Changes

- `PgVector.query()` now supports querying by metadata filters alone without providing a query vector — useful when you need to retrieve records by metadata without performing similarity search. ([#13286](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/13286))

  **Before** (queryVector was required):

  ```ts
  const results = await pgVector.query({
    indexName: 'my-index',
    queryVector: [0.1, 0.2, ...],
    filter: { category: 'docs' },
  });
  ```

  **After** (metadata-only query):

  ```ts
  const results = await pgVector.query({
    indexName: 'my-index',
    filter: { category: 'docs' },
  });
  // Returns matching records with score: 0 (no similarity ranking)
  ```

  At least one of `queryVector` or `filter` must be provided. When `queryVector` is omitted, results are returned with `score: 0` since no similarity computation is performed.

### Patch Changes

- Set REPLICA IDENTITY USING INDEX on the mastra_workflow_snapshot table so PostgreSQL logical replication can track row updates. The table only has a UNIQUE constraint with no PRIMARY KEY, which caused "cannot update table because it does not have a replica identity and publishes updates" errors when logical replication was enabled. Fixes #13097. ([#13178](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/13178))

- Fixed observation activation to always preserve a minimum amount of context. Previously, swapping buffered observation chunks could unexpectedly drop the context window to near-zero tokens. ([#13476](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/13476))

  - @mastra/core@1.6.0-alpha.0

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- Added workspace and skill storage domains with full CRUD, versioning, and implementations across LibSQL, Postgres, and MongoDB. Added `editor.workspace` and `editor.skill` namespaces for managing workspace configurations and skill definitions through the editor. Agents stored in the editor can now reference workspaces (by ID or inline config) and skills, with full hydration to runtime `Workspace` instances during agent resolution. ([#13156](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/13156))

  **Filesystem-native skill versioning (draft → publish model):**

  Skills are versioned as filesystem trees with content-addressable blob storage. The editing surface (live filesystem) is separated from the serving surface (versioned blob store), enabling a `draft → publish` workflow:
  - `editor.skill.publish(skillId, source, skillPath)` — Snapshots a skill directory from the filesystem into blob storage, creates a new version with a tree manifest, and sets `activeVersionId`
  - Version switching via `editor.skill.update({ id, activeVersionId })` — Points the skill to a previous version without re-publishing
  - Publishing a skill automatically invalidates cached agents that reference it, so they re-hydrate with the updated version on next access

  **Agent skill resolution strategies:**

  Agents can reference skills with different resolution strategies:
  - `strategy: 'latest'` — Resolves the skill's active version (honors `activeVersionId` for rollback)
  - `pin: '<versionId>'` — Pins to a specific version, immune to publishes
  - `strategy: 'live'` — Reads directly from the live filesystem (no blob store)

  **Blob storage infrastructure:**
  - `BlobStore` abstract class for content-addressable storage keyed by SHA-256 hash
  - `InMemoryBlobStore` for testing
  - LibSQL, Postgres, and MongoDB implementations
  - `S3BlobStore` for storing blobs in S3 or S3-compatible storage (AWS, R2, MinIO, DO Spaces)
  - `BlobStoreProvider` interface and `MastraEditorConfig.blobStores` registry for pluggable blob storage
  - `VersionedSkillSource` and `CompositeVersionedSkillSource` for reading skill files from the blob store at runtime

  **New storage types:**
  - `StorageWorkspaceSnapshotType` and `StorageSkillSnapshotType` with corresponding input/output types
  - `StorageWorkspaceRef` for ID-based or inline workspace references on agents
  - `StorageSkillConfig` for per-agent skill overrides (`pin`, `strategy`, description, instructions)
  - `SkillVersionTree` and `SkillVersionTreeEntry` for tree manifests
  - `StorageBlobEntry` for content-addressable blob entries
  - `SKILL_BLOBS_SCHEMA` for the `mastra_skill_blobs` table

  **New editor namespaces:**
  - `editor.workspace` — CRUD for workspace configs, plus `hydrateSnapshotToWorkspace()` for resolving to runtime `Workspace` instances
  - `editor.skill` — CRUD for skill definitions, plus `publish()` for filesystem-to-blob snapshots

  **Provider registries:**
  - `MastraEditorConfig` accepts `filesystems`, `sandboxes`, and `blobStores` provider registries (keyed by provider ID)
  - Built-in `local` filesystem and sandbox providers are auto-registered
  - `editor.resolveBlobStore()` resolves from provider registry or falls back to the storage backend's blobs domain
  - Providers expose `id`, `name`, `description`, `configSchema` (JSON Schema for UI form rendering), and a factory method

  **Storage adapter support:**
  - LibSQL: Full `workspaces`, `skills`, and `blobs` domain implementations
  - Postgres: Full `workspaces`, `skills`, and `blobs` domain implementations
  - MongoDB: Full `workspaces`, `skills`, and `blobs` domain implementations
  - All three include `workspace`, `skills`, and `skillsFormat` fields on agent versions

  **Server endpoints:**
  - `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /stored/workspaces` — CRUD for stored workspaces
  - `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /stored/skills` — CRUD for stored skills
  - `POST /stored/skills/:id/publish` — Publish a skill from a filesystem source

  ```ts
  import { MastraEditor } from '@mastra/editor';
  import { s3FilesystemProvider, s3BlobStoreProvider } from '@mastra/s3';
  import { e2bSandboxProvider } from '@mastra/e2b';

  const editor = new MastraEditor({
    filesystems: { s3: s3FilesystemProvider },
    sandboxes: { e2b: e2bSandboxProvider },
    blobStores: { s3: s3BlobStoreProvider },
  });

  // Create a skill and publish it
  const skill = await editor.skill.create({
    name: 'Code Review',
    description: 'Reviews code for best practices',
    instructions: 'Analyze the code and provide feedback...',
  });
  await editor.skill.publish(skill.id, source, 'skills/code-review');

  // Agents resolve skills by strategy
  await editor.agent.create({
    name: 'Dev Assistant',
    model: { provider: 'openai', name: 'gpt-4' },
    workspace: { type: 'id', workspaceId: workspace.id },
    skills: { [skill.id]: { strategy: 'latest' } },
    skillsFormat: 'xml',
  });
  ```

- Added draft/publish version management for all editor primitives (agents, scorers, MCP clients, prompt blocks). ([#13061](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/13061))

  **Status filtering on list endpoints** — All list endpoints now accept a `?status=draft|published|archived` query parameter to filter by entity status. Defaults to `published` to preserve backward compatibility.

  **Draft vs published resolution on get-by-id endpoints** — All get-by-id endpoints now accept `?status=draft` to resolve the entity with its latest (unpublished) version, or `?status=published` (default) to resolve with the active published version.

  **Edits no longer auto-publish** — When updating any primitive, a new version is created but `activeVersionId` is no longer automatically updated. Edits stay as drafts until explicitly published via the activate endpoint.

  **Full version management for all primitives** — Scorers, MCP clients, and prompt blocks now have the same version management API that agents have: list versions, create version snapshots, get specific versions, activate/publish, restore from a previous version, delete versions, and compare versions.

  **New prompt block CRUD routes** — Prompt blocks now have full server routes (`GET /stored/prompt-blocks`, `GET /stored/prompt-blocks/:id`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`).

  **New version endpoints** — Each primitive now exposes 7 version management endpoints under `/stored/{type}/:id/versions` (list, create, get, activate, restore, delete, compare).

  ```ts
  // Fetch the published version (default behavior, backward compatible)
  const published = await fetch('/api/stored/scorers/my-scorer');

  // Fetch the draft version for editing in the UI
  const draft = await fetch('/api/stored/scorers/my-scorer?status=draft');

  // Publish a specific version
  await fetch('/api/stored/scorers/my-scorer/versions/abc123/activate', { method: 'POST' });

  // Compare two versions
  const diff = await fetch('/api/stored/scorers/my-scorer/versions/compare?from=v1&to=v2');
  ```

### Patch Changes

- Dataset schemas now appear in the Edit Dataset dialog. Previously the `inputSchema` and `groundTruthSchema` fields were not passed to the dialog, so editing a dataset always showed empty schemas. ([#13175](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/13175))

  Schema edits in the JSON editor no longer cause the cursor to jump to the top of the field. Typing `{"type": "object"}` in the schema editor now behaves like a normal text input instead of resetting on every keystroke.

  Validation errors are now surfaced when updating a dataset schema that conflicts with existing items. For example, adding a `required: ["name"]` constraint when existing items lack a `name` field now shows "2 existing item(s) fail validation" in the dialog instead of silently dropping the error.

  Disabling a dataset schema from the Studio UI now correctly clears it. Previously the server converted `null` (disable) to `undefined` (no change), so the old schema persisted and validation continued.

  Workflow schemas fetched via `client.getWorkflow().getSchema()` are now correctly parsed. The server serializes schemas with `superjson`, but the client was using plain `JSON.parse`, yielding a `{json: {...}}` wrapper instead of the actual JSON Schema object.

- CMS draft support with status badges for agents. ([#13194](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/13194))
  - Agent list now resolves the latest (draft) version for each stored agent, showing current edits rather than the last published state.
  - Added `hasDraft` and `activeVersionId` fields to the agent list API response.
  - Agent list badges: "Published" (green) when a published version exists, "Draft" (colored when unpublished changes exist, grayed out otherwise).
  - Added `resolvedVersionId` to all `StorageResolved*Type` types so the server can detect whether the latest version differs from the active version.
  - Added `status` option to `GetByIdOptions` to allow resolving draft vs published versions through the editor layer.
  - Fixed editor cache not being cleared on version activate, restore, and delete — all four versioned domains (agents, scorers, prompt-blocks, mcp-clients) now clear the cache after version mutations.
  - Added `ALTER TABLE` migration for `mastra_agent_versions` in libsql and pg to add newer columns (`mcpClients`, `requestContextSchema`, `workspace`, `skills`, `skillsFormat`).

- Added scorer version management and CMS draft/publish flow for scorers. ([#13194](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/13194))
  - Added scorer version methods to the client SDK: `listVersions`, `createVersion`, `getVersion`, `activateVersion`, `restoreVersion`, `deleteVersion`, `compareVersions`.
  - Added `ScorerVersionCombobox` for navigating scorer versions with Published/Draft labels.
  - Scorer edit page now supports Save (draft) and Publish workflows with an "Unpublished changes" indicator.
  - Storage list methods for agents and scorers no longer default to filtering only published entities, allowing drafts to appear in the playground.

## 1.5.0-alpha.0

### Minor Changes

- Added workspace and skill storage domains with full CRUD, versioning, and implementations across LibSQL, Postgres, and MongoDB. Added `editor.workspace` and `editor.skill` namespaces for managing workspace configurations and skill definitions through the editor. Agents stored in the editor can now reference workspaces (by ID or inline config) and skills, with full hydration to runtime `Workspace` instances during agent resolution. ([#13156](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/13156))

  **Filesystem-native skill versioning (draft → publish model):**

  Skills are versioned as filesystem trees with content-addressable blob storage. The editing surface (live filesystem) is separated from the serving surface (versioned blob store), enabling a `draft → publish` workflow:
  - `editor.skill.publish(skillId, source, skillPath)` — Snapshots a skill directory from the filesystem into blob storage, creates a new version with a tree manifest, and sets `activeVersionId`
  - Version switching via `editor.skill.update({ id, activeVersionId })` — Points the skill to a previous version without re-publishing
  - Publishing a skill automatically invalidates cached agents that reference it, so they re-hydrate with the updated version on next access

  **Agent skill resolution strategies:**

  Agents can reference skills with different resolution strategies:
  - `strategy: 'latest'` — Resolves the skill's active version (honors `activeVersionId` for rollback)
  - `pin: '<versionId>'` — Pins to a specific version, immune to publishes
  - `strategy: 'live'` — Reads directly from the live filesystem (no blob store)

  **Blob storage infrastructure:**
  - `BlobStore` abstract class for content-addressable storage keyed by SHA-256 hash
  - `InMemoryBlobStore` for testing
  - LibSQL, Postgres, and MongoDB implementations
  - `S3BlobStore` for storing blobs in S3 or S3-compatible storage (AWS, R2, MinIO, DO Spaces)
  - `BlobStoreProvider` interface and `MastraEditorConfig.blobStores` registry for pluggable blob storage
  - `VersionedSkillSource` and `CompositeVersionedSkillSource` for reading skill files from the blob store at runtime

  **New storage types:**
  - `StorageWorkspaceSnapshotType` and `StorageSkillSnapshotType` with corresponding input/output types
  - `StorageWorkspaceRef` for ID-based or inline workspace references on agents
  - `StorageSkillConfig` for per-agent skill overrides (`pin`, `strategy`, description, instructions)
  - `SkillVersionTree` and `SkillVersionTreeEntry` for tree manifests
  - `StorageBlobEntry` for content-addressable blob entries
  - `SKILL_BLOBS_SCHEMA` for the `mastra_skill_blobs` table

  **New editor namespaces:**
  - `editor.workspace` — CRUD for workspace configs, plus `hydrateSnapshotToWorkspace()` for resolving to runtime `Workspace` instances
  - `editor.skill` — CRUD for skill definitions, plus `publish()` for filesystem-to-blob snapshots

  **Provider registries:**
  - `MastraEditorConfig` accepts `filesystems`, `sandboxes`, and `blobStores` provider registries (keyed by provider ID)
  - Built-in `local` filesystem and sandbox providers are auto-registered
  - `editor.resolveBlobStore()` resolves from provider registry or falls back to the storage backend's blobs domain
  - Providers expose `id`, `name`, `description`, `configSchema` (JSON Schema for UI form rendering), and a factory method

  **Storage adapter support:**
  - LibSQL: Full `workspaces`, `skills`, and `blobs` domain implementations
  - Postgres: Full `workspaces`, `skills`, and `blobs` domain implementations
  - MongoDB: Full `workspaces`, `skills`, and `blobs` domain implementations
  - All three include `workspace`, `skills`, and `skillsFormat` fields on agent versions

  **Server endpoints:**
  - `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /stored/workspaces` — CRUD for stored workspaces
  - `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /stored/skills` — CRUD for stored skills
  - `POST /stored/skills/:id/publish` — Publish a skill from a filesystem source

  ```ts
  import { MastraEditor } from '@mastra/editor';
  import { s3FilesystemProvider, s3BlobStoreProvider } from '@mastra/s3';
  import { e2bSandboxProvider } from '@mastra/e2b';

  const editor = new MastraEditor({
    filesystems: { s3: s3FilesystemProvider },
    sandboxes: { e2b: e2bSandboxProvider },
    blobStores: { s3: s3BlobStoreProvider },
  });

  // Create a skill and publish it
  const skill = await editor.skill.create({
    name: 'Code Review',
    description: 'Reviews code for best practices',
    instructions: 'Analyze the code and provide feedback...',
  });
  await editor.skill.publish(skill.id, source, 'skills/code-review');

  // Agents resolve skills by strategy
  await editor.agent.create({
    name: 'Dev Assistant',
    model: { provider: 'openai', name: 'gpt-4' },
    workspace: { type: 'id', workspaceId: workspace.id },
    skills: { [skill.id]: { strategy: 'latest' } },
    skillsFormat: 'xml',
  });
  ```

- Added draft/publish version management for all editor primitives (agents, scorers, MCP clients, prompt blocks). ([#13061](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/13061))

  **Status filtering on list endpoints** — All list endpoints now accept a `?status=draft|published|archived` query parameter to filter by entity status. Defaults to `published` to preserve backward compatibility.

  **Draft vs published resolution on get-by-id endpoints** — All get-by-id endpoints now accept `?status=draft` to resolve the entity with its latest (unpublished) version, or `?status=published` (default) to resolve with the active published version.

  **Edits no longer auto-publish** — When updating any primitive, a new version is created but `activeVersionId` is no longer automatically updated. Edits stay as drafts until explicitly published via the activate endpoint.

  **Full version management for all primitives** — Scorers, MCP clients, and prompt blocks now have the same version management API that agents have: list versions, create version snapshots, get specific versions, activate/publish, restore from a previous version, delete versions, and compare versions.

  **New prompt block CRUD routes** — Prompt blocks now have full server routes (`GET /stored/prompt-blocks`, `GET /stored/prompt-blocks/:id`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`).

  **New version endpoints** — Each primitive now exposes 7 version management endpoints under `/stored/{type}/:id/versions` (list, create, get, activate, restore, delete, compare).

  ```ts
  // Fetch the published version (default behavior, backward compatible)
  const published = await fetch('/api/stored/scorers/my-scorer');

  // Fetch the draft version for editing in the UI
  const draft = await fetch('/api/stored/scorers/my-scorer?status=draft');

  // Publish a specific version
  await fetch('/api/stored/scorers/my-scorer/versions/abc123/activate', { method: 'POST' });

  // Compare two versions
  const diff = await fetch('/api/stored/scorers/my-scorer/versions/compare?from=v1&to=v2');
  ```

  - Added `ScorerVersionCombobox` for navigating scorer versions with Published/Draft labels.
  - Scorer edit page now supports Save (draft) and Publish workflows with an "Unpublished changes" indicator.
  - Storage list methods for agents and scorers no longer default to filtering only published entities, allowing drafts to appear in the playground.

  - @mastra/core@1.5.0-alpha.0

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- Added datasets and experiments storage implementations. Includes dataset CRUD, item versioning with SCD-2, experiment runs with scorer results, and table/type configurations for dataset and experiment tables. ([#12747](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/12747))

  **Requires `@mastra/core` >= 1.4.0**

### Patch Changes

- Fixed agent version storage to persist the requestContextSchema field. Previously, requestContextSchema was defined on the agent snapshot type but was not included in the database schema, INSERT statements, or row parsing logic, causing it to be silently dropped when saving and loading agent versions. ([#13003](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/13003))

- Fixed observational memory writing non-integer token counts to PostgreSQL, which caused `invalid input syntax for type integer` errors. Token counts are now correctly rounded to integers before all database writes. ([#12976](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/12976))

- Added MCP client storage domain and ToolProvider interface for integrating external tool catalogs with stored agents. ([#12974](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/12974))

  **MCP Client Storage**

  New storage domain for persisting MCP client configurations with CRUD operations. Each MCP client can contain multiple servers with independent tool selection:

  ```ts
  // Store an MCP client with multiple servers
  await storage.mcpClients.create({
    id: 'my-mcp',
    name: 'My MCP Client',
    servers: {
      'github-server': { url: 'https://mcp.github.com/sse' },
      'slack-server': { url: 'https://mcp.slack.com/sse' },
    },
  });
  ```

  LibSQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB storage adapters all implement the new MCP client domain.

  **ToolProvider Interface**

  New `ToolProvider` interface at `@mastra/core/tool-provider` enables third-party tool catalog integration (e.g., Composio, Arcade AI):

  ```ts
  import type { ToolProvider } from '@mastra/core/tool-provider';

  # Providers implement: listToolkits(), listTools(), getToolSchema(), resolveTools()
  ```

  `resolveTools()` receives `requestContext` from the current request, enabling per-user API keys and credentials in multi-tenant setups:

  ```ts
  const tools = await provider.resolveTools(slugs, configs, {
    requestContext: { apiKey: 'user-specific-key', userId: 'tenant-123' },
  });
  ```

  **Tool Selection Semantics**

  Both `mcpClients` and `integrationTools` on stored agents follow consistent three-state selection:
  - `{ tools: undefined }` — provider registered, no tools selected
  - `{ tools: {} }` — all tools from provider included
  - `{ tools: { 'TOOL_SLUG': { description: '...' } } }` — specific tools with optional overrides

- Fixed schema exports to include indexes, timestamp triggers, and the observational memory table so exports are complete. ([#12990](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/12990))

- Updated dependencies [[`7ef618f`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/7ef618f3c49c27e2f6b27d7f564c557c0734325b), [`b373564`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/b37356491d43b4d53067f10cb669abaf2502f218), [`927c2af`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/927c2af9792286c122e04409efce0f3c804f777f), [`b896b41`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/b896b41343de7fcc14442fb40fe82d189e65bbe2), [`6415277`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/6415277a438faa00db2af850ead5dee25f40c428), [`0831bbb`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/0831bbb5bc750c18e9b22b45f18687c964b70828), [`63f7eda`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/63f7eda605eb3e0c8c35ee3912ffe7c999c69f69), [`a5b67a3`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/a5b67a3589a74415feb663a55d1858324a2afde9), [`877b02c`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/877b02cdbb15e199184c7f2b8f217be8d3ebada7), [`7567222`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/7567222b1366f0d39980594792dd9d5060bfe2ab), [`af71458`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/af71458e3b566f09c11d0e5a0a836dc818e7a24a), [`eb36bd8`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/eb36bd8c52fcd6ec9674ac3b7a6412405b5983e1), [`3cbf121`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/3cbf121f55418141924754a83102aade89835947)]:

  - @mastra/core@1.4.0-alpha.0

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- **Updated storage adapters for generic storage domain API** ([#12846](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/12846))

  All storage adapters now implement the unified `VersionedStorageDomain` method names. Entity-specific methods (`createAgent`, `getAgentById`, `deleteAgent`, etc.) have been replaced with generic equivalents (`create`, `getById`, `delete`, etc.) across agents, prompt blocks, and scorer definitions domains.

  Added `scorer-definitions` domain support to all adapters.

  **Before:**

  ```ts
  const store = storage.getStore('agents');
  await store.createAgent({ agent: input });
  await store.getAgentById({ id: 'abc' });
  await store.deleteAgent({ id: 'abc' });
  ```

  **After:**

  ```ts
  const store = storage.getStore('agents');
  await store.create({ agent: input });
  await store.getById('abc');
  await store.delete('abc');
  ```

### Patch Changes

- Fixed observational memory progress bars resetting to zero after agent responses finish. ([#12934](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/12934))

- Fixed issues with stored agents ([#12790](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/12790))

- Fixed cross-schema constraint checks in multi-schema PostgreSQL setups so tables and indexes are created in the intended schema. Single-schema (default) setups are unaffected. ([#12868](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/12868))

- Supporting changes for async buffering in observational memory, including new config options, streaming events, and UI markers. ([#12891](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/12891))

- Fixed PostgreSQL constraint names exceeding 63-byte identifier limit. Schema-prefixed constraint names are now truncated to fit within PostgreSQL's identifier length limit, preventing "relation already exists" errors when restarting the dev server with schema names longer than 13 characters. Fixes #12679. ([#12687](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/12687))

  - @mastra/core@1.3.0

## 1.3.0-alpha.1

### Patch Changes

- Fixed observational memory progress bars resetting to zero after agent responses finish. The messages and observations sidebar bars now retain their values on stream completion, cancellation, and page reload. Also added a buffer-status endpoint so buffering badges resolve with accurate token counts instead of spinning forever when buffering outlives the stream. ([#12934](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/12934))

- Updated dependencies [[`b31c922`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/b31c922215b513791d98feaea1b98784aa00803a)]:
  - @mastra/core@1.3.0-alpha.2

## 1.3.0-alpha.0

### Minor Changes

- **Updated storage adapters for generic storage domain API** ([#12846](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/12846))

  All storage adapters now implement the unified `VersionedStorageDomain` method names. Entity-specific methods (`createAgent`, `getAgentById`, `deleteAgent`, etc.) have been replaced with generic equivalents (`create`, `getById`, `delete`, etc.) across agents, prompt blocks, and scorer definitions domains.

  Added `scorer-definitions` domain support to all adapters.

  **Before:**

  ```ts
  const store = storage.getStore('agents');
  await store.createAgent({ agent: input });
  await store.getAgentById({ id: 'abc' });
  await store.deleteAgent({ id: 'abc' });
  ```

  **After:**

  ```ts
  const store = storage.getStore('agents');
  await store.create({ agent: input });
  await store.getById('abc');
  await store.delete('abc');
  ```

### Patch Changes

- Fixed issues with stored agents ([#12790](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/12790))

- Fixed cross-schema constraint checks in multi-schema PostgreSQL setups so tables and indexes are created in the intended schema. Single-schema (default) setups are unaffected. ([#12868](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/12868))

- **Async buffering for observational memory is now enabled by default.** Observations are pre-computed in the background as conversations grow — when the context window fills up, buffered observations activate instantly with no blocking LLM call. This keeps agents responsive during long conversations. ([#12891](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/12891))

  **Default settings:**
  - `observation.bufferTokens: 0.2` — buffer every 20% of `messageTokens` (~6k tokens with the default 30k threshold)
  - `observation.bufferActivation: 0.8` — on activation, retain 20% of the message window
  - `reflection.bufferActivation: 0.5` — start background reflection at 50% of the observation threshold

  **Disabling async buffering:**

  Set `observation.bufferTokens: false` to disable async buffering for both observations and reflections:

  ```ts
  const memory = new Memory({
    options: {
      observationalMemory: {
        model: 'google/gemini-2.5-flash',
        observation: {
          bufferTokens: false,
        },
      },
    },
  });
  ```

  **Model is now required** when passing an observational memory config object. Use `observationalMemory: true` for the default (google/gemini-2.5-flash), or set a model explicitly:

  ```ts
  // Uses default model (google/gemini-2.5-flash)
  observationalMemory: true

  // Explicit model
  observationalMemory: {
    model: "google/gemini-2.5-flash",
  }
  ```

  **`shareTokenBudget` requires `bufferTokens: false`** (temporary limitation). If you use `shareTokenBudget: true`, you must explicitly disable async buffering:

  ```ts
  observationalMemory: {
    model: "google/gemini-2.5-flash",
    shareTokenBudget: true,
    observation: { bufferTokens: false },
  }
  ```

  **New streaming event:** `data-om-status` replaces `data-om-progress` with a structured status object containing active window usage, buffered observation/reflection state, and projected activation impact.

  **Buffering markers:** New `data-om-buffering-start`, `data-om-buffering-end`, and `data-om-buffering-failed` streaming events for UI feedback during background operations.

- Fixed PostgreSQL constraint names exceeding 63-byte identifier limit. Schema-prefixed constraint names are now truncated to fit within PostgreSQL's identifier length limit, preventing "relation already exists" errors when restarting the dev server with schema names longer than 13 characters. Fixes #12679. ([#12687](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/12687))

- Added prompt block storage implementations. Each store supports full CRUD for prompt blocks and their versions, including JSON serialization for rules and metadata. Also updated agent instructions serialization to support the new `AgentInstructionBlock` array format alongside plain strings. ([#12776](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/12776))

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Added Observational Memory — a new memory system that keeps your agent's context window small while preserving long-term memory across conversations. ([#12599](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/12599))

  **Why:** Long conversations cause context rot and waste tokens. Observational Memory compresses conversation history into observations (5–40x compression) and periodically condenses those into reflections. Your agent stays fast and focused, even after thousands of messages.

  **Usage:**

  ```ts
  import { Memory } from '@mastra/memory';
  import { PostgresStore } from '@mastra/pg';

  const memory = new Memory({
    storage: new PostgresStore({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL }),
    options: {
      observationalMemory: true,
    },
  });

  const agent = new Agent({
    name: 'my-agent',
    model: openai('gpt-4o'),
    memory,
  });
  ```

  **What's new:**
  - `observationalMemory: true` enables the three-tier memory system (recent messages → observations → reflections)
  - Thread-scoped (per-conversation) and resource-scoped (shared across all threads for a user) modes
  - Manual `observe()` API for triggering observation outside the normal agent loop
  - New OM storage methods for pg, libsql, and mongodb adapters (conditionally enabled)
  - `Agent.findProcessor()` method for looking up processors by ID
  - `processorStates` for persisting processor state across loop iterations
  - Abort signal propagation to processors
  - `ProcessorStreamWriter` for custom stream events from processors

### Patch Changes

- Created @mastra/editor package for managing and resolving stored agent configurations ([#12631](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/12631))

  This major addition introduces the editor package, which provides a complete solution for storing, versioning, and instantiating agent configurations from a database. The editor seamlessly integrates with Mastra's storage layer to enable dynamic agent management.

  **Key Features:**
  - **Agent Storage & Retrieval**: Store complete agent configurations including instructions, model settings, tools, workflows, nested agents, scorers, processors, and memory configuration
  - **Version Management**: Create and manage multiple versions of agents, with support for activating specific versions
  - **Dependency Resolution**: Automatically resolves and instantiates all agent dependencies (tools, workflows, sub-agents, etc.) from the Mastra registry
  - **Caching**: Built-in caching for improved performance when repeatedly accessing stored agents
  - **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper typing for stored configurations

  **Usage Example:**

  ```typescript
  import { MastraEditor } from '@mastra/editor';
  import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core';

  // Initialize editor with Mastra
  const mastra = new Mastra({
    /* config */
    editor: new MastraEditor(),
  });

  // Store an agent configuration
  const agentId = await mastra.storage.stores?.agents?.createAgent({
    name: 'customer-support',
    instructions: 'Help customers with inquiries',
    model: { provider: 'openai', name: 'gpt-4' },
    tools: ['search-kb', 'create-ticket'],
    workflows: ['escalation-flow'],
    memory: { vector: 'pinecone-db' },
  });

  // Retrieve and use the stored agent
  const agent = await mastra.getEditor()?.getStoredAgentById(agentId);
  const response = await agent?.generate('How do I reset my password?');

  // List all stored agents
  const agents = await mastra.getEditor()?.listStoredAgents({ pageSize: 10 });
  ```

  **Storage Improvements:**
  - Fixed JSONB handling in LibSQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB adapters
  - Improved agent resolution queries to properly merge version data
  - Enhanced type safety for serialized configurations

- Updated dependencies [[`e6fc281`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/e6fc281896a3584e9e06465b356a44fe7faade65), [`97be6c8`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/97be6c8963130fca8a664fcf99d7b3a38e463595), [`2770921`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/2770921eec4d55a36b278d15c3a83f694e462ee5), [`b1695db`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/b1695db2d7be0c329d499619c7881899649188d0), [`5fe1fe0`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/5fe1fe0109faf2c87db34b725d8a4571a594f80e), [`4133d48`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/4133d48eaa354cdb45920dc6265732ffbc96788d), [`5dd01cc`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/5dd01cce68d61874aa3ecbd91ee17884cfd5aca2), [`13e0a2a`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/13e0a2a2bcec01ff4d701274b3727d5e907a6a01), [`f6673b8`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/f6673b893b65b7d273ad25ead42e990704cc1e17), [`cd6be8a`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/cd6be8ad32741cd41cabf508355bb31b71e8a5bd), [`9eb4e8e`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/9eb4e8e39efbdcfff7a40ff2ce07ce2714c65fa8), [`c987384`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/c987384d6c8ca844a9701d7778f09f5a88da7f9f), [`cb8cc12`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/cb8cc12bfadd526aa95a01125076f1da44e4afa7), [`aa37c84`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/aa37c84d29b7db68c72517337932ef486c316275), [`62f5d50`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/62f5d5043debbba497dacb7ab008fe86b38b8de3), [`47eba72`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/47eba72f0397d0d14fbe324b97940c3d55e5a525)]:

  - **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper typing for stored configurations

  **Usage Example:**

  ```typescript
  import { MastraEditor } from '@mastra/editor';
  import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core';

  // Initialize editor with Mastra
  const mastra = new Mastra({
    /* config */
    editor: new MastraEditor(),
  });

  // Store an agent configuration
  const agentId = await mastra.storage.stores?.agents?.createAgent({
    name: 'customer-support',
    instructions: 'Help customers with inquiries',
    model: { provider: 'openai', name: 'gpt-4' },
    tools: ['search-kb', 'create-ticket'],
    workflows: ['escalation-flow'],
    memory: { vector: 'pinecone-db' },
  });

  // Retrieve and use the stored agent
  const agent = await mastra.getEditor()?.getStoredAgentById(agentId);
  const response = await agent?.generate('How do I reset my password?');

  // List all stored agents
  const agents = await mastra.getEditor()?.listStoredAgents({ pageSize: 10 });
  ```

  **Storage Improvements:**
  - Fixed JSONB handling in LibSQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB adapters
  - Improved agent resolution queries to properly merge version data
  - Enhanced type safety for serialized configurations

  - @mastra/core@1.2.0-alpha.1

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Restructured stored agents to use a thin metadata record with versioned configuration snapshots. ([#12488](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/12488))

  The agent record now only stores metadata fields (id, status, activeVersionId, authorId, metadata, timestamps). All configuration fields (name, instructions, model, tools, etc.) live exclusively in version snapshot rows, enabling full version history and rollback.

  **Key changes:**
  - Stored Agent records are now thin metadata-only (StorageAgentType)
  - All config lives in version snapshots (StorageAgentSnapshotType)
  - New resolved type (StorageResolvedAgentType) merges agent record + active version config
  - Renamed `ownerId` to `authorId` for multi-tenant filtering
  - Changed `memory` field type from `string` to `Record<string, unknown>`
  - Added `status` field ('draft' | 'published') to agent records
  - Flattened CreateAgent/UpdateAgent input types (config fields at top level, no nested snapshot)
  - Version config columns are top-level in the agent_versions table (no single snapshot jsonb column)
  - List endpoints return resolved agents (thin record + active version config)
  - Auto-versioning on update with retention limits and race condition handling

- Added dynamic agent management with CRUD operations and version tracking ([#12038](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/12038))

  **New Features:**
  - Create, edit, and delete agents directly from the Mastra Studio UI
  - Full version history for agents with compare and restore capabilities
  - Visual diff viewer to compare agent configurations across versions
  - Agent creation modal with comprehensive configuration options (model selection, instructions, tools, workflows, sub-agents, memory)
  - AI-powered instruction enhancement

  **Storage:**
  - New storage interfaces for stored agents and agent versions
  - PostgreSQL, LibSQL, and MongoDB implementations included
  - In-memory storage for development and testing

  **API:**
  - RESTful endpoints for agent CRUD operations
  - Version management endpoints (create, list, activate, restore, delete, compare)
  - Automatic versioning on agent updates when enabled

  **Client SDK:**
  - JavaScript client with full support for stored agents and versions
  - Type-safe methods for all CRUD and version operations

  **Usage Example:**

  ```typescript
  // Server-side: Configure storage
  import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core';
  import { PgAgentsStorage } from '@mastra/pg';

  const mastra = new Mastra({
    agents: { agentOne },
    storage: {
      agents: new PgAgentsStorage({
        connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
      }),
    },
  });

  // Client-side: Use the SDK
  import { MastraClient } from '@mastra/client-js';

  const client = new MastraClient({ baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3000' });

  // Create a stored agent
  const agent = await client.createStoredAgent({
    name: 'Customer Support Agent',
    description: 'Handles customer inquiries',
    model: { provider: 'ANTHROPIC', name: 'claude-sonnet-4-5' },
    instructions: 'You are a helpful customer support agent...',
    tools: ['search', 'email'],
  });

  // Create a version snapshot
  await client.storedAgent(agent.id).createVersion({
    name: 'v1.0 - Initial release',
    changeMessage: 'First production version',
  });

  // Compare versions
  const diff = await client.storedAgent(agent.id).compareVersions('version-1', 'version-2');
  ```

  **Why:**
  This feature enables teams to manage agents dynamically without code changes, making it easier to iterate on agent configurations and maintain a complete audit trail of changes.

- Added `status` field to `listTraces` response. The status field indicates the trace state: `success` (completed without error), `error` (has error), or `running` (still in progress). This makes it easier to filter and display traces by their current state without having to derive it from the `error` and `endedAt` fields. ([#12213](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/12213))

### Patch Changes

- Stored agent edits no longer fail silently. PATCH requests now save changes correctly. ([#12504](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/12504))

- Fix PATCH request JSON-body handling in `@mastra/client-js` so stored agent edit flows work correctly. Fix stored agent schema migration in `@mastra/libsql` and `@mastra/pg` to drop and recreate the versions table when the old snapshot-based schema is detected, clean up stale draft records from partial create failures, and remove lingering legacy tables. Restores create and edit flows for stored agents. ([#12504](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/12504))

  - @mastra/core@1.1.0-alpha.0

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- Moving scorers under the eval domain, api method consistency, prebuilt evals, scorers require ids. ([#9589](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9589))

- Every Mastra primitive (agent, MCPServer, workflow, tool, processor, scorer, and vector) now has a get, list, and add method associated with it. Each primitive also now requires an id to be set. ([#9675](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9675))

  Primitives that are added to other primitives are also automatically added to the Mastra instance

- Update handlers to use `listWorkflowRuns` instead of `getWorkflowRuns`. Fix type names from `StoragelistThreadsByResourceIdInput/Output` to `StorageListThreadsByResourceIdInput/Output`. ([#9507](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9507))

- Remove `getMessagesPaginated()` and add `perPage: false` support ([#9670](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9670))

  Removes deprecated `getMessagesPaginated()` method. The `listMessages()` API and score handlers now support `perPage: false` to fetch all records without pagination limits.

  **Storage changes:**
  - `StoragePagination.perPage` type changed from `number` to `number | false`
  - All storage implementations support `perPage: false`:
    - Memory: `listMessages()`
    - Scores: `listScoresBySpan()`, `listScoresByRunId()`, `listScoresByExecutionId()`
  - HTTP query parser accepts `"false"` string (e.g., `?perPage=false`)

  **Memory changes:**
  - `memory.query()` parameter type changed from `StorageGetMessagesArg` to `StorageListMessagesInput`
  - Uses flat parameters (`page`, `perPage`, `include`, `filter`, `vectorSearchString`) instead of `selectBy` object

  **Stricter validation:**
  - `listMessages()` requires non-empty, non-whitespace `threadId` (throws error instead of returning empty results)

  **Migration:**

  ```typescript
  // Storage/Memory: Replace getMessagesPaginated with listMessages
  - storage.getMessagesPaginated({ threadId, selectBy: { pagination: { page: 0, perPage: 20 } } })
  + storage.listMessages({ threadId, page: 0, perPage: 20 })
  + storage.listMessages({ threadId, page: 0, perPage: false })  // Fetch all

  // Memory: Replace selectBy with flat parameters
  - memory.query({ threadId, selectBy: { last: 20, include: [...] } })
  + memory.query({ threadId, perPage: 20, include: [...] })

  // Client SDK
  - thread.getMessagesPaginated({ selectBy: { pagination: { page: 0 } } })
  + thread.listMessages({ page: 0, perPage: 20 })
  ```

- **Removed `storage.getMessages()`** ([#9695](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9695))

  The `getMessages()` method has been removed from all storage implementations. Use `listMessages()` instead, which provides pagination support.

  **Migration:**

  ```typescript
  // Before
  const messages = await storage.getMessages({ threadId: 'thread-1' });

  // After
  const result = await storage.listMessages({
    threadId: 'thread-1',
    page: 0,
    perPage: 50,
  });
  const messages = result.messages; // Access messages array
  console.log(result.total); // Total count
  console.log(result.hasMore); // Whether more pages exist
  ```

  **Message ordering default**

  `listMessages()` defaults to ASC (oldest first) ordering by `createdAt`, matching the previous `getMessages()` behavior.

  **To use DESC ordering (newest first):**

  ```typescript
  const result = await storage.listMessages({
    threadId: 'thread-1',
    orderBy: { field: 'createdAt', direction: 'DESC' },
  });
  ```

  **Renamed `client.getThreadMessages()` → `client.listThreadMessages()`**

  **Migration:**

  ```typescript
  // Before
  const response = await client.getThreadMessages(threadId, { agentId });

  // After
  const response = await client.listThreadMessages(threadId, { agentId });
  ```

  The response format remains the same.

  **Removed `StorageGetMessagesArg` type**

  Use `StorageListMessagesInput` instead:

  ```typescript
  // Before
  import type { StorageGetMessagesArg } from '@mastra/core';

  // After
  import type { StorageListMessagesInput } from '@mastra/core';
  ```

- Bump minimum required Node.js version to 22.13.0 ([#9706](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9706))

- Add new list methods to storage API: `listMessages`, `listMessagesById`, `listThreadsByResourceId`, and `listWorkflowRuns`. Most methods are currently wrappers around existing methods. Full implementations will be added when migrating away from legacy methods. ([#9489](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9489))

- Rename RuntimeContext to RequestContext ([#9511](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9511))

- Implement listMessages API for replacing previous methods ([#9531](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9531))

- Remove `getThreadsByResourceId` and `getThreadsByResourceIdPaginated` methods from storage interfaces in favor of `listThreadsByResourceId`. The new method uses `offset`/`limit` pagination and a nested `orderBy` object structure (`{ field, direction }`). ([#9536](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9536))

- Remove `getMessagesById` method from storage interfaces in favor of `listMessagesById`. The new method only returns V2-format messages and removes the format parameter, simplifying the API surface. Users should migrate from `getMessagesById({ messageIds, format })` to `listMessagesById({ messageIds })`. ([#9534](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9534))

- Renamed a bunch of observability/tracing-related things to drop the AI prefix. ([#9744](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9744))

- Pagination APIs now use `page`/`perPage` instead of `offset`/`limit` ([#9592](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9592))

  All storage and memory pagination APIs have been updated to use `page` (0-indexed) and `perPage` instead of `offset` and `limit`, aligning with standard REST API patterns.

  **Affected APIs:**
  - `Memory.listThreadsByResourceId()`
  - `Memory.listMessages()`
  - `Storage.listWorkflowRuns()`

  **Migration:**

  ```typescript
  // Before
  await memory.listThreadsByResourceId({
    resourceId: 'user-123',
    offset: 20,
    limit: 10,
  });

  // After
  await memory.listThreadsByResourceId({
    resourceId: 'user-123',
    page: 2, // page = Math.floor(offset / limit)
    perPage: 10,
  });

  // Before
  await memory.listMessages({
    threadId: 'thread-456',
    offset: 20,
    limit: 10,
  });

  // After
  await memory.listMessages({
    threadId: 'thread-456',
    page: 2,
    perPage: 10,
  });

  // Before
  await storage.listWorkflowRuns({
    workflowName: 'my-workflow',
    offset: 20,
    limit: 10,
  });

  // After
  await storage.listWorkflowRuns({
    workflowName: 'my-workflow',
    page: 2,
    perPage: 10,
  });
  ```

  **Additional improvements:**
  - Added validation for negative `page` values in all storage implementations
  - Improved `perPage` validation to handle edge cases (negative values, `0`, `false`)
  - Added reusable query parser utilities for consistent validation in handlers

- ```ts ([#9709](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9709))
  import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core';
  import { Observability } from '@mastra/observability'; // Explicit import

  const mastra = new Mastra({
    ...other_config,
    observability: new Observability({
      default: { enabled: true },
    }), // Instance
  });
  ```

  Instead of:

  ```ts
  import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core';
  import '@mastra/observability/init'; // Explicit import

  const mastra = new Mastra({
    ...other_config,
    observability: {
      default: { enabled: true },
    },
  });
  ```

  Also renamed a bunch of:
  - `Tracing` things to `Observability` things.
  - `AI-` things to just things.

- Removed old tracing code based on OpenTelemetry ([#9237](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9237))

- Mark as stable ([`83d5942`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/83d5942669ce7bba4a6ca4fd4da697a10eb5ebdc))

- Renamed `MastraMessageV2` to `MastraDBMessage` ([#9255](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9255))
  Made the return format of all methods that return db messages consistent. It's always `{ messages: MastraDBMessage[] }` now, and messages can be converted after that using `@mastra/ai-sdk/ui`'s `toAISdkV4/5Messages()` function

- moved ai-tracing code into @mastra/observability ([#9661](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9661))

- Remove legacy evals from Mastra ([#9491](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9491))

### Minor Changes

- Add stored agents support ([#10953](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/10953))

  Agents can now be stored in the database and loaded at runtime. This lets you persist agent configurations and dynamically create executable Agent instances from storage.

  ```typescript
  import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core';
  import { LibSQLStore } from '@mastra/libsql';

  const mastra = new Mastra({
    storage: new LibSQLStore({ url: ':memory:' }),
    tools: { myTool },
    scorers: { myScorer },
  });

  // Create agent in storage via API or directly
  await mastra.getStorage().createAgent({
    agent: {
      id: 'my-agent',
      name: 'My Agent',
      instructions: 'You are helpful',
      model: { provider: 'openai', name: 'gpt-4' },
      tools: { myTool: {} },
      scorers: { myScorer: { sampling: { type: 'ratio', rate: 0.5 } } },
    },
  });

  // Load and use the agent
  const agent = await mastra.getStoredAgentById('my-agent');
  const response = await agent.generate('Hello!');

  // List all stored agents with pagination
  const { agents, total, hasMore } = await mastra.listStoredAgents({
    page: 0,
    perPage: 10,
  });
  ```

  Also adds a memory registry to Mastra so stored agents can reference memory instances by key.

- Update peer dependencies to match core package version bump (1.0.0) ([#9237](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9237))

- Changed JSON columns from TEXT to JSONB in `mastra_threads` and `mastra_workflow_snapshot` tables. ([#11853](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11853))

  **Why this change?**

  These were the last remaining columns storing JSON as TEXT. This change aligns them with other tables that already use JSONB, enabling native JSON operators and improved performance. See [#8978](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/issues/8978) for details.

  **Columns Changed:**
  - `mastra_threads.metadata` - Thread metadata
  - `mastra_workflow_snapshot.snapshot` - Workflow run state

  **PostgreSQL**

  Migration Required - PostgreSQL enforces column types, so existing tables must be migrated. Note: Migration will fail if existing column values contain invalid JSON.

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE mastra_threads
  ALTER COLUMN metadata TYPE jsonb
  USING metadata::jsonb;

  ALTER TABLE mastra_workflow_snapshot
  ALTER COLUMN snapshot TYPE jsonb
  USING snapshot::jsonb;
  ```

  **LibSQL**

  No Migration Required - LibSQL now uses native SQLite JSONB format (added in SQLite 3.45) for ~3x performance improvement on JSON operations. The changes are fully backwards compatible:
  - Existing TEXT JSON data continues to work
  - New data is stored in binary JSONB format
  - Both formats can coexist in the same table
  - All JSON functions (`json_extract`, etc.) work on both formats

  New installations automatically use JSONB. Existing applications continue to work without any changes.

- Introduce StorageDomain base class for composite storage support ([#11249](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11249))

  Storage adapters now use a domain-based architecture where each domain (memory, workflows, scores, observability, agents) extends a `StorageDomain` base class with `init()` and `dangerouslyClearAll()` methods.

  **Key changes:**
  - Add `StorageDomain` abstract base class that all domain storage classes extend
  - Add `InMemoryDB` class for shared state across in-memory domain implementations
  - All storage domains now implement `dangerouslyClearAll()` for test cleanup
  - Remove `operations` from public `StorageDomains` type (now internal to each adapter)
  - Add flexible client/config patterns - domains accept either an existing database client or config to create one internally

  **Why this matters:**

  This enables composite storage where you can use different database adapters per domain:

  ```typescript
  import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core';
  import { PostgresStore } from '@mastra/pg';
  import { ClickhouseStore } from '@mastra/clickhouse';

  // Use Postgres for most domains but Clickhouse for observability
  const mastra = new Mastra({
    storage: new PostgresStore({
      connectionString: 'postgres://...',
    }),
    // Future: override specific domains
    // observability: new ClickhouseStore({ ... }).getStore('observability'),
  });
  ```

  **Standalone domain usage:**

  Domains can now be used independently with flexible configuration:

  ```typescript
  import { MemoryLibSQL } from '@mastra/libsql/memory';

  // Option 1: Pass config to create client internally
  const memory = new MemoryLibSQL({
    url: 'file:./local.db',
  });

  // Option 2: Pass existing client for shared connections
  import { createClient } from '@libsql/client';
  const client = createClient({ url: 'file:./local.db' });
  const memory = new MemoryLibSQL({ client });
  ```

  **Breaking changes:**
  - `StorageDomains` type no longer includes `operations` - access via `getStore()` instead
  - Domain base classes now require implementing `dangerouslyClearAll()` method

- Refactor storage architecture to use domain-specific stores via `getStore()` pattern ([#11361](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11361))

  ### Summary

  This release introduces a new storage architecture that replaces passthrough methods on `MastraStorage` with domain-specific storage interfaces accessed via `getStore()`. This change reduces code duplication across storage adapters and provides a cleaner, more modular API.

  ### Migration Guide

  All direct method calls on storage instances should be updated to use `getStore()`:

  ```typescript
  // Before
  const thread = await storage.getThreadById({ threadId });
  await storage.persistWorkflowSnapshot({ workflowName, runId, snapshot });
  await storage.createSpan(span);

  // After
  const memory = await storage.getStore('memory');
  const thread = await memory?.getThreadById({ threadId });

  const workflows = await storage.getStore('workflows');
  await workflows?.persistWorkflowSnapshot({ workflowName, runId, snapshot });

  const observability = await storage.getStore('observability');
  await observability?.createSpan(span);
  ```

  ### Available Domains
  - **`memory`**: Thread and message operations (`getThreadById`, `saveThread`, `saveMessages`, etc.)
  - **`workflows`**: Workflow state persistence (`persistWorkflowSnapshot`, `loadWorkflowSnapshot`, `getWorkflowRunById`, etc.)
  - **`scores`**: Evaluation scores (`saveScore`, `listScoresByScorerId`, etc.)
  - **`observability`**: Tracing and spans (`createSpan`, `updateSpan`, `getTrace`, etc.)
  - **`agents`**: Stored agent configurations (`createAgent`, `getAgentById`, `listAgents`, etc.)

  ### Breaking Changes
  - Passthrough methods have been removed from `MastraStorage` base class
  - All storage adapters now require accessing domains via `getStore()`
  - The `stores` property on storage instances is now the canonical way to access domain storage

  ### Internal Changes
  - Each storage adapter now initializes domain-specific stores in its constructor
  - Domain stores share database connections and handle their own table initialization

- Unified observability schema with entity-based span identification ([#11132](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11132))

  ## What changed

  Spans now use a unified identification model with `entityId`, `entityType`, and `entityName` instead of separate `agentId`, `toolId`, `workflowId` fields.

  **Before:**

  ```typescript
  // Old span structure
  span.agentId; // 'my-agent'
  span.toolId; // undefined
  span.workflowId; // undefined
  ```

  **After:**

  ```typescript
  // New span structure
  span.entityType; // EntityType.AGENT
  span.entityId; // 'my-agent'
  span.entityName; // 'My Agent'
  ```

  ## New `listTraces()` API

  Query traces with filtering, pagination, and sorting:

  ```typescript
  const { spans, pagination } = await storage.listTraces({
    filters: {
      entityType: EntityType.AGENT,
      entityId: 'my-agent',
      userId: 'user-123',
      environment: 'production',
      status: TraceStatus.SUCCESS,
      startedAt: { start: new Date('2024-01-01'), end: new Date('2024-01-31') },
    },
    pagination: { page: 0, perPage: 50 },
    orderBy: { field: 'startedAt', direction: 'DESC' },
  });
  ```

  **Available filters:** date ranges (`startedAt`, `endedAt`), entity (`entityType`, `entityId`, `entityName`), identity (`userId`, `organizationId`), correlation IDs (`runId`, `sessionId`, `threadId`), deployment (`environment`, `source`, `serviceName`), `tags`, `metadata`, and `status`.

  ## New retrieval methods
  - `getSpan({ traceId, spanId })` - Get a single span
  - `getRootSpan({ traceId })` - Get the root span of a trace
  - `getTrace({ traceId })` - Get all spans for a trace

  ## Backward compatibility

  The legacy `getTraces()` method continues to work. When you pass `name: "agent run: my-agent"`, it automatically transforms to `entityId: "my-agent", entityType: AGENT`.

  ## Migration

  **Automatic:** SQL-based stores (PostgreSQL, LibSQL, MSSQL) automatically add new columns to existing `spans` tables on initialization. Existing data is preserved with new columns set to `NULL`.

  **No action required:** Your existing code continues to work. Adopt the new fields and `listTraces()` API at your convenience.

- Remove pg-promise dependency and use pg.Pool directly ([#11450](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11450))

  **BREAKING CHANGE**: This release replaces pg-promise with vanilla node-postgres (`pg`).

  ### Breaking Changes
  - **Removed `store.pgp`**: The pg-promise library instance is no longer exposed
  - **Config change**: `{ client: pgPromiseDb }` is no longer supported. Use `{ pool: pgPool }` instead
  - **Cloud SQL config**: `max` and `idleTimeoutMillis` must now be passed via `pgPoolOptions`

  ### New Features
  - **`store.pool`**: Exposes the underlying `pg.Pool` for direct database access or ORM integration (e.g., Drizzle)
  - **`store.db`**: Provides a `DbClient` interface with methods like `one()`, `any()`, `tx()`, etc.
  - **`store.db.connect()`**: Acquire a client for session-level operations

  ### Migration

  ```typescript
  // Before (pg-promise)
  import pgPromise from 'pg-promise';
  const pgp = pgPromise();
  const client = pgp(connectionString);
  const store = new PostgresStore({ id: 'my-store', client });

  // After (pg.Pool)
  import { Pool } from 'pg';
  const pool = new Pool({ connectionString });
  const store = new PostgresStore({ id: 'my-store', pool });

  // Use store.pool with any library that accepts a pg.Pool
  ```

- Add `disableInit` option to all storage adapters ([#10851](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/10851))

  Adds a new `disableInit` config option to all storage providers that allows users to disable automatic table creation/migrations at runtime. This is useful for CI/CD pipelines where you want to run migrations during deployment with elevated credentials, then run the application with `disableInit: true` so it doesn't attempt schema changes at runtime.

  ```typescript
  // CI/CD script - run migrations
  const storage = new PostgresStore({
    connectionString: DATABASE_URL,
    id: 'pg-storage',
  });
  await storage.init();

  // Runtime - skip auto-init
  const storage = new PostgresStore({
    connectionString: DATABASE_URL,
    id: 'pg-storage',
    disableInit: true,
  });
  ```

### Patch Changes

- Add embedded documentation support for Mastra packages ([#11472](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11472))

  Mastra packages now include embedded documentation in the published npm package under `dist/docs/`. This enables coding agents and AI assistants to understand and use the framework by reading documentation directly from `node_modules`.

  Each package includes:
  - **SKILL.md** - Entry point explaining the package's purpose and capabilities
  - **SOURCE_MAP.json** - Machine-readable index mapping exports to types and implementation files
  - **Topic folders** - Conceptual documentation organized by feature area

  Documentation is driven by the `packages` frontmatter field in MDX files, which maps docs to their corresponding packages. CI validation ensures all docs include this field.

- Added `exportSchemas()` function to generate Mastra database schema as SQL DDL without a database connection. ([#11448](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11448))

  **What's New**

  You can now export your Mastra database schema as SQL DDL statements without connecting to a database. This is useful for:
  - Generating migration scripts
  - Reviewing the schema before deployment
  - Creating database schemas in environments where the application doesn't have CREATE privileges

  **Example**

  ```typescript
  import { exportSchemas } from '@mastra/pg';

  // Export schema for default 'public' schema
  const ddl = exportSchemas();
  console.log(ddl);

  // Export schema for a custom schema
  const customDdl = exportSchemas('my_schema');
  // Creates: CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS "my_schema"; and all tables within it
  ```

- Fix pg listThreadsByResourceId page number validation ([#9671](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9671))

- Standardize error IDs across all storage and vector stores using centralized helper functions (`createStorageErrorId` and `createVectorErrorId`). This ensures consistent error ID patterns (`MASTRA_STORAGE_{STORE}_{OPERATION}_{STATUS}` and `MASTRA_VECTOR_{STORE}_{OPERATION}_{STATUS}`) across the codebase for better error tracking and debugging. ([#10913](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/10913))

- Fix missing timezone columns during PostgreSQL spans table migration ([#11419](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11419))

  Fixes issue #11410 where users upgrading to observability beta.7 encountered errors about missing `startedAtZ`, `endedAtZ`, `createdAtZ`, and `updatedAtZ` columns. The migration now properly adds timezone-aware columns for all timestamp fields when upgrading existing databases, ensuring compatibility with the new observability implementation that requires these columns for batch operations.

- Fix saveScore not persisting ID correctly, breaking getScoreById retrieval ([#10915](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/10915))

  **What Changed**
  - saveScore now correctly returns scores that can be retrieved with getScoreById
  - Validation errors now include contextual information (scorer, entity, trace details) for easier debugging

  **Impact**
  Previously, calling getScoreById after saveScore would return null because the generated ID wasn't persisted to the database. This is now fixed across all store implementations, ensuring consistent behavior and data integrity.

- Add new deleteVectors, updateVector by filter ([#10408](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/10408))

- PostgresStore was setting `this.stores = {}` in the constructor and only populating it in the async `init()` method. This broke Memory because it checks `storage.stores.memory` synchronously in `getInputProcessors()` before `init()` is called. ([#10943](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/10943))

  The fix moves domain instance creation to the constructor. This is safe because pg-promise creates database connections lazily when queries are executed.

- Fix `listWorkflowRuns` failing with "unsupported Unicode escape sequence" error when filtering by status on snapshots containing null characters (`\u0000`) or unpaired Unicode surrogates (`\uD800-\uDFFF`). ([#11616](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11616))

  The fix uses `regexp_replace` to sanitize problematic escape sequences before casting to JSONB in the WHERE clause, while preserving the original data in the returned results.

- qualify vector type to fix schema lookup ([#10786](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/10786))

- - Fixed TypeScript errors where `threadId: string | string[]` was being passed to places expecting `Scalar` type ([#10663](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/10663))
  - Added proper multi-thread support for `listMessages` across all adapters when `threadId` is an array
  - Updated `_getIncludedMessages` to look up message threadId by ID (since message IDs are globally unique)
  - **upstash**: Added `msg-idx:{messageId}` index for O(1) message lookups (backwards compatible with fallback to scan for old messages, with automatic backfill)

- Fix severe performance issue with semantic recall on large message tables ([#11365](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11365))

  The `_getIncludedMessages` method was using `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY createdAt)` which scanned all messages in a thread to assign row numbers. On tables with 1M+ rows, this caused 5-10 minute query times.

  Replaced with cursor-based pagination using the existing `(thread_id, createdAt)` index:

  ```sql
  -- Before: scans entire thread
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY "createdAt" ASC)

  -- After: uses index, fetches only needed rows
  WHERE createdAt <= (target) ORDER BY createdAt DESC LIMIT N
  ```

  Performance improvement: ~49x faster (832ms → 17ms) for typical semantic recall queries.

- Fixed PostgreSQL migration errors when upgrading from v0.x to v1 ([#11633](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11633))

  **What changed:** PostgreSQL storage now automatically adds missing `spanId` and `requestContext` columns to the scorers table during initialization, preventing "column does not exist" errors when upgrading from v0.x to v1.0.0.

  **Why:** Previously, upgrading to v1 could fail with errors like `column "requestContext" of relation "mastra_scorers" does not exist` if your database was created with an older version.

  Related: #11631

- Preserve error details when thrown from workflow steps ([#10992](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/10992))

  Workflow errors now retain custom properties like `statusCode`, `responseHeaders`, and `cause` chains. This enables error-specific recovery logic in your applications.

  **Before:**

  ```typescript
  const result = await workflow.execute({ input });
  if (result.status === 'failed') {
    // Custom error properties were lost
    console.log(result.error); // "Step execution failed" (just a string)
  }
  ```

  **After:**

  ```typescript
  const result = await workflow.execute({ input });
  if (result.status === 'failed') {
    // Custom properties are preserved
    console.log(result.error.message); // "Step execution failed"
    console.log(result.error.statusCode); // 429
    console.log(result.error.cause?.name); // "RateLimitError"
  }
  ```

  **Type change:** `WorkflowState.error` and `WorkflowRunState.error` types changed from `string | Error` to `SerializedError`.

  Other changes:
  - Added `UpdateWorkflowStateOptions` type for workflow state updates

- Added `startExclusive` and `endExclusive` options to `dateRange` filter for message queries. ([#11479](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11479))

  **What changed:** The `filter.dateRange` parameter in `listMessages()` and `Memory.recall()` now supports `startExclusive` and `endExclusive` boolean options. When set to `true`, messages with timestamps exactly matching the boundary are excluded from results.

  **Why this matters:** Enables cursor-based pagination for chat applications. When new messages arrive during a session, offset-based pagination can skip or duplicate messages. Using `endExclusive: true` with the oldest message's timestamp as a cursor ensures consistent pagination without gaps or duplicates.

  **Example:**

  ```typescript
  // Get first page
  const page1 = await memory.recall({
    threadId: 'thread-123',
    perPage: 10,
    orderBy: { field: 'createdAt', direction: 'DESC' },
  });

  // Get next page using cursor-based pagination
  const oldestMessage = page1.messages[page1.messages.length - 1];
  const page2 = await memory.recall({
    threadId: 'thread-123',
    perPage: 10,
    orderBy: { field: 'createdAt', direction: 'DESC' },
    filter: {
      dateRange: {
        end: oldestMessage.createdAt,
        endExclusive: true, // Excludes the cursor message
      },
    },
  });

- Ensure score responses match saved payloads for Mastra Stores. ([#10557](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/10557))

- Fixed duplicate spans migration issue across all storage backends. When upgrading from older versions, existing duplicate (traceId, spanId) combinations in the spans table could prevent the unique constraint from being created. The migration deduplicates spans before adding the constraint. ([#12073](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/12073))

  **Deduplication rules (in priority order):**
  1. Keep completed spans (those with `endedAt` set) over incomplete spans
  2. Among spans with the same completion status, keep the one with the newest `updatedAt`
  3. Use `createdAt` as the final tiebreaker

  **What changed:**
  - Added `migrateSpans()` method to observability stores for manual migration
  - Added `checkSpansMigrationStatus()` method to check if migration is needed
  - All stores use optimized single-query deduplication to avoid memory issues on large tables

  **Usage example:**

  ```typescript
  const observability = await storage.getStore('observability');
  const status = await observability.checkSpansMigrationStatus();
  if (status.needsMigration) {
    const result = await observability.migrateSpans();
    console.log(`Migration complete: ${result.duplicatesRemoved} duplicates removed`);
  }
  ```

  Fixes #11840

- Fix thread timestamps being returned in incorrect timezone from listThreadsByResourceId ([#11498](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11498))

  The method was not using the timezone-aware columns (createdAtZ/updatedAtZ), causing timestamps to be interpreted in local timezone instead of UTC. Now correctly uses TIMESTAMPTZ columns with fallback for legacy data.

- Add storage composition to MastraStorage ([#11401](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11401))

  `MastraStorage` can now compose storage domains from different adapters. Use it when you need different databases for different purposes - for example, PostgreSQL for memory and workflows, but a different database for observability.

  ```typescript
  import { MastraStorage } from '@mastra/core/storage';
  import { MemoryPG, WorkflowsPG, ScoresPG } from '@mastra/pg';
  import { MemoryLibSQL } from '@mastra/libsql';

  // Compose domains from different stores
  const storage = new MastraStorage({
    id: 'composite',
    domains: {
      memory: new MemoryLibSQL({ url: 'file:./local.db' }),
      workflows: new WorkflowsPG({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL }),
      scores: new ScoresPG({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL }),
    },
  });
  ```

  **Breaking changes:**
  - `storage.supports` property no longer exists
  - `StorageSupports` type is no longer exported from `@mastra/core/storage`

  All stores now support the same features. For domain availability, use `getStore()`:

  ```typescript
  const store = await storage.getStore('memory');
  if (store) {
    // domain is available
  }
  ```

- - PostgreSQL: use `getSqlType()` in `createTable` instead of `toUpperCase()` ([#11112](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11112))
  - LibSQL: use `getSqlType()` in `createTable`, return `JSONB` for jsonb type (matches SQLite 3.45+ support)
  - ClickHouse: use `getSqlType()` in `createTable` instead of `COLUMN_TYPES` constant, add missing types (uuid, float, boolean)
  - Remove unused `getSqlType()` and `getDefaultValue()` from `MastraStorage` base class (all stores use `StoreOperations` versions)

- Add delete workflow run API ([#10991](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/10991))

  ```typescript
  await workflow.deleteWorkflowRunById(runId);
  ```

- Add halfvec type support for large dimension embeddings ([#11002](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11002))

  Adds `vectorType` option to `createIndex()` for choosing between full precision (`vector`) and half precision (`halfvec`) storage. halfvec uses 2 bytes per dimension instead of 4, enabling indexes on embeddings up to 4000 dimensions.

  ```typescript
  await pgVector.createIndex({
    indexName: 'large-embeddings',
    dimension: 3072, // text-embedding-3-large
    metric: 'cosine',
    vectorType: 'halfvec',
  });
  ```

  Requires pgvector >= 0.7.0 for halfvec support. Docker compose files updated to use pgvector 0.8.0.

- Fixes "invalid input syntax for type json" error in tracing with PostgreSQL. ([#9154](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9154))

- Added a unified `transformScoreRow` function in `@mastra/core/storage` that provides schema-driven row transformation for score data. This eliminates code duplication across 10 storage adapters while maintaining store-specific behavior through configurable options: ([#10648](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/10648))
  - `preferredTimestampFields`: Preferred source fields for timestamps (PostgreSQL, Cloudflare D1)
  - `convertTimestamps`: Convert timestamp strings to Date objects (MSSQL, MongoDB, ClickHouse)
  - `nullValuePattern`: Skip values matching pattern (ClickHouse's `'_null_'`)
  - `fieldMappings`: Map source column names to schema fields (LibSQL's `additionalLLMContext`)

  Each store adapter now uses the unified function with appropriate options, reducing ~200 lines of duplicate transformation logic while ensuring consistent behavior across all storage backends.

- Added new `listThreads` method for flexible thread filtering across all storage adapters. ([#11832](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11832))

  **New Features**
  - Filter threads by `resourceId`, `metadata`, or both (with AND logic for metadata key-value pairs)
  - All filter parameters are optional, allowing you to list all threads or filter as needed
  - Full pagination and sorting support

  **Example Usage**

  ```typescript
  // List all threads
  const allThreads = await memory.listThreads({});

  // Filter by resourceId only
  const userThreads = await memory.listThreads({
    filter: { resourceId: 'user-123' },
  });

  // Filter by metadata only
  const supportThreads = await memory.listThreads({
    filter: { metadata: { category: 'support' } },
  });

  // Filter by both with pagination
  const filteredThreads = await memory.listThreads({
    filter: {
      resourceId: 'user-123',
      metadata: { priority: 'high', status: 'open' },
    },
    orderBy: { field: 'updatedAt', direction: 'DESC' },
    page: 0,
    perPage: 20,
  });
  ```

  **Security Improvements**
  - Added validation to prevent SQL injection via malicious metadata keys
  - Added pagination parameter validation to prevent integer overflow attacks

- Aligned vector store configuration with underlying library APIs, giving you access to all library options directly. ([#11742](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11742))

  **Why this change?**

  Previously, each vector store defined its own configuration types that only exposed a subset of the underlying library's options. This meant users couldn't access advanced features like authentication, SSL, compression, or custom headers without creating their own client instances. Now, the configuration types extend the library types directly, so all options are available.

  **@mastra/libsql** (Breaking)

  Renamed `connectionUrl` to `url` to match the `@libsql/client` API and align with LibSQLStorage.

  ```typescript
  // Before
  new LibSQLVector({ id: 'my-vector', connectionUrl: 'file:./db.sqlite' });

  // After
  new LibSQLVector({ id: 'my-vector', url: 'file:./db.sqlite' });
  ```

  **@mastra/opensearch** (Breaking)

  Renamed `url` to `node` and added support for all OpenSearch `ClientOptions` including authentication, SSL, and compression.

  ```typescript
  // Before
  new OpenSearchVector({ id: 'my-vector', url: 'http://localhost:9200' });

  // After
  new OpenSearchVector({ id: 'my-vector', node: 'http://localhost:9200' });

  // With authentication (now possible)
  new OpenSearchVector({
    id: 'my-vector',
    node: 'https://localhost:9200',
    auth: { username: 'admin', password: 'admin' },
    ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false },
  });
  ```

  **@mastra/pinecone** (Breaking)

  Removed `environment` parameter. Use `controllerHostUrl` instead (the actual Pinecone SDK field name). Added support for all `PineconeConfiguration` options.

  ```typescript
  // Before
  new PineconeVector({ id: 'my-vector', apiKey: '...', environment: '...' });

  // After
  new PineconeVector({ id: 'my-vector', apiKey: '...' });

  // With custom controller host (if needed)
  new PineconeVector({ id: 'my-vector', apiKey: '...', controllerHostUrl: '...' });
  ```

  **@mastra/clickhouse**

  Added support for all `ClickHouseClientConfigOptions` like `request_timeout`, `compression`, `keep_alive`, and `database`. Existing configurations continue to work unchanged.

  **@mastra/cloudflare, @mastra/cloudflare-d1, @mastra/lance, @mastra/libsql, @mastra/mongodb, @mastra/pg, @mastra/upstash**

  Improved logging by replacing `console.warn` with structured logger in workflow storage domains.

  **@mastra/deployer-cloud**

  Updated internal LibSQLVector configuration for compatibility with the new API.

- Fixed PostgreSQL storage issues after JSONB migration. ([#11906](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11906))

  **Bug Fixes**
  - Fixed `clearTable()` using incorrect default schema. The method was checking for table existence in the 'mastra' schema instead of PostgreSQL's default 'public' schema, causing table truncation to be skipped and leading to duplicate key violations in tests and production code that uses `dangerouslyClearAll()`.
  - Fixed `listWorkflowRuns()` status filter failing with "function regexp_replace(jsonb, ...) does not exist" error. After the TEXT to JSONB migration, the query tried to use `regexp_replace()` directly on a JSONB column. Now casts to text first: `regexp_replace(snapshot::text, ...)`.
  - Added Unicode sanitization when persisting workflow snapshots to handle null characters (\u0000) and unpaired surrogates (\uD800-\uDFFF) that PostgreSQL's JSONB type rejects, preventing "unsupported Unicode escape sequence" errors.

- Add restart method to workflow run that allows restarting an active workflow run ([#9750](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9750))
  Add status filter to `listWorkflowRuns`
  Add automatic restart to restart active workflow runs when server starts

- Renamed MastraStorage to MastraCompositeStore for better clarity. The old MastraStorage name remains available as a deprecated alias for backward compatibility, but will be removed in a future version. ([#12093](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/12093))

  **Migration:**

  Update your imports and usage:

  ```typescript
  // Before
  import { MastraStorage } from '@mastra/core/storage';

  const storage = new MastraStorage({
    id: 'composite',
    domains: { ... }
  });

  // After
  import { MastraCompositeStore } from '@mastra/core/storage';

  const storage = new MastraCompositeStore({
    id: 'composite',
    domains: { ... }
  });
  ```

  The new name better reflects that this is a composite storage implementation that routes different domains (workflows, traces, messages) to different underlying stores, avoiding confusion with the general "Mastra Storage" concept.

- Adds thread cloning to create independent copies of conversations that can diverge. ([#11517](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11517))

  ```typescript
  // Clone a thread
  const { thread, clonedMessages } = await memory.cloneThread({
    sourceThreadId: 'thread-123',
    title: 'My Clone',
    options: {
      messageLimit: 10, // optional: only copy last N messages
    },
  });

  // Check if a thread is a clone
  if (memory.isClone(thread)) {
    const source = await memory.getSourceThread(thread.id);
  }

  // List all clones of a thread
  const clones = await memory.listClones('thread-123');
  ```

  Includes:
  - Storage implementations for InMemory, PostgreSQL, LibSQL, Upstash
  - API endpoint: `POST /api/memory/threads/:threadId/clone`
  - Embeddings created for cloned messages (semantic recall)
  - Clone button in playground UI Memory tab

- Added pre-configured client support for all storage adapters. ([#11302](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11302))

  **What changed**

  All storage adapters now accept pre-configured database clients in addition to connection credentials. This allows you to customize client settings (connection pools, timeouts, interceptors) before passing them to Mastra.

  **Example**

  ```typescript
  import { createClient } from '@clickhouse/client';
  import { ClickhouseStore } from '@mastra/clickhouse';

  // Create and configure client with custom settings
  const client = createClient({
    url: 'http://localhost:8123',
    username: 'default',
    password: '',
    request_timeout: 60000,
  });

  // Pass pre-configured client to store
  const store = new ClickhouseStore({
    id: 'my-store',
    client,
  });
  ```

  **Additional improvements**
  - Added input validation for required connection parameters (URL, credentials) with clear error messages

- Add index configuration options to storage stores ([#11311](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11311))

  Storage stores now support two new configuration options for index management:
  - `skipDefaultIndexes`: When `true`, default performance indexes are not created during `init()`. Useful for custom index strategies or reducing initialization time.
  - `indexes`: Array of custom index definitions to create during `init()`. Indexes are routed to the appropriate domain based on table/collection name.

  ```typescript
  // Skip default indexes and use custom ones
  const store = new PostgresStore({
    connectionString: '...',
    skipDefaultIndexes: true,
    indexes: [{ name: 'threads_type_idx', table: 'mastra_threads', columns: ["metadata->>'type'"] }],
  });

  // MongoDB equivalent
  const mongoStore = new MongoDBStore({
    url: 'mongodb://...',
    skipDefaultIndexes: true,
    indexes: [{ collection: 'mastra_threads', keys: { 'metadata.type': 1 }, options: { name: 'threads_type_idx' } }],
  });
  ```

  Domain classes (e.g., `MemoryPG`, `MemoryStorageMongoDB`) also accept these options for standalone usage.

  - @mastra/core@1.0.0

## 1.0.0-beta.15

### Patch Changes

- Fixed duplicate spans migration issue across all storage backends. When upgrading from older versions, existing duplicate (traceId, spanId) combinations in the spans table could prevent the unique constraint from being created. The migration deduplicates spans before adding the constraint. ([#12073](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/12073))

  **Deduplication rules (in priority order):**
  1. Keep completed spans (those with `endedAt` set) over incomplete spans
  2. Among spans with the same completion status, keep the one with the newest `updatedAt`
  3. Use `createdAt` as the final tiebreaker

  **What changed:**
  - Added `migrateSpans()` method to observability stores for manual migration
  - Added `checkSpansMigrationStatus()` method to check if migration is needed
  - All stores use optimized single-query deduplication to avoid memory issues on large tables

  **Usage example:**

  ```typescript
  const observability = await storage.getStore('observability');
  const status = await observability.checkSpansMigrationStatus();
  if (status.needsMigration) {
    const result = await observability.migrateSpans();
    console.log(`Migration complete: ${result.duplicatesRemoved} duplicates removed`);
  }
  ```

  Fixes #11840

- Renamed MastraStorage to MastraCompositeStore for better clarity. The old MastraStorage name remains available as a deprecated alias for backward compatibility, but will be removed in a future version. ([#12093](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/12093))

  **Migration:**

  Update your imports and usage:

  ```typescript
  // Before
  import { MastraStorage } from '@mastra/core/storage';

  const storage = new MastraStorage({
    id: 'composite',
    domains: { ... }
  });

  // After
  import { MastraCompositeStore } from '@mastra/core/storage';

  const storage = new MastraCompositeStore({
    id: 'composite',
    domains: { ... }
  });
  ```

  The new name better reflects that this is a composite storage implementation that routes different domains (workflows, traces, messages) to different underlying stores, avoiding confusion with the general "Mastra Storage" concept.

## 1.0.0-beta.14

### Patch Changes

- Added new `listThreads` method for flexible thread filtering across all storage adapters. ([#11832](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11832))

  **New Features**
  - Filter threads by `resourceId`, `metadata`, or both (with AND logic for metadata key-value pairs)
  - All filter parameters are optional, allowing you to list all threads or filter as needed
  - Full pagination and sorting support

  **Example Usage**

  ```typescript
  // List all threads
  const allThreads = await memory.listThreads({});

  // Filter by resourceId only
  const userThreads = await memory.listThreads({
    filter: { resourceId: 'user-123' },
  });

  // Filter by metadata only
  const supportThreads = await memory.listThreads({
    filter: { metadata: { category: 'support' } },
  });

  // Filter by both with pagination
  const filteredThreads = await memory.listThreads({
    filter: {
      resourceId: 'user-123',
      metadata: { priority: 'high', status: 'open' },
    },
    orderBy: { field: 'updatedAt', direction: 'DESC' },
    page: 0,
    perPage: 20,
  });
  ```

  **Security Improvements**
  - Added validation to prevent SQL injection via malicious metadata keys
  - Added pagination parameter validation to prevent integer overflow attacks

- Updated dependencies [[`ed3e3dd`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/ed3e3ddec69d564fe2b125e083437f76331f1283), [`6833c69`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/6833c69607418d257750bbcdd84638993d343539), [`47b1c16`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/47b1c16a01c7ffb6765fe1e499b49092f8b7eba3), [`3a76a80`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/3a76a80284cb71a0faa975abb3d4b2a9631e60cd), [`8538a0d`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/8538a0d232619bf55dad7ddc2a8b0ca77c679a87), [`9312dcd`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/9312dcd1c6f5b321929e7d382e763d95fdc030f5)]:

## 1.0.0-beta.13

### Minor Changes

- Changed JSON columns from TEXT to JSONB in `mastra_threads` and `mastra_workflow_snapshot` tables. ([#11853](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11853))

  **Why this change?**

  These were the last remaining columns storing JSON as TEXT. This change aligns them with other tables that already use JSONB, enabling native JSON operators and improved performance. See [#8978](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/issues/8978) for details.

  **Columns Changed:**
  - `mastra_threads.metadata` - Thread metadata
  - `mastra_workflow_snapshot.snapshot` - Workflow run state

  **PostgreSQL**

  Migration Required - PostgreSQL enforces column types, so existing tables must be migrated. Note: Migration will fail if existing column values contain invalid JSON.

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE mastra_threads
  ALTER COLUMN metadata TYPE jsonb
  USING metadata::jsonb;

  ALTER TABLE mastra_workflow_snapshot
  ALTER COLUMN snapshot TYPE jsonb
  USING snapshot::jsonb;
  ```

  **LibSQL**

  No Migration Required - LibSQL now uses native SQLite JSONB format (added in SQLite 3.45) for ~3x performance improvement on JSON operations. The changes are fully backwards compatible:
  - Existing TEXT JSON data continues to work
  - New data is stored in binary JSONB format
  - Both formats can coexist in the same table
  - All JSON functions (`json_extract`, etc.) work on both formats

  New installations automatically use JSONB. Existing applications continue to work without any changes.

### Patch Changes

- Fix `listWorkflowRuns` failing with "unsupported Unicode escape sequence" error when filtering by status on snapshots containing null characters (`\u0000`) or unpaired Unicode surrogates (`\uD800-\uDFFF`). ([#11616](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11616))

  The fix uses `regexp_replace` to sanitize problematic escape sequences before casting to JSONB in the WHERE clause, while preserving the original data in the returned results.

- Fixed PostgreSQL migration errors when upgrading from v0.x to v1 ([#11633](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11633))

  **What changed:** PostgreSQL storage now automatically adds missing `spanId` and `requestContext` columns to the scorers table during initialization, preventing "column does not exist" errors when upgrading from v0.x to v1.0.0.

  **Why:** Previously, upgrading to v1 could fail with errors like `column "requestContext" of relation "mastra_scorers" does not exist` if your database was created with an older version.

  Related: #11631

- Aligned vector store configuration with underlying library APIs, giving you access to all library options directly. ([#11742](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11742))

  **Why this change?**

  Previously, each vector store defined its own configuration types that only exposed a subset of the underlying library's options. This meant users couldn't access advanced features like authentication, SSL, compression, or custom headers without creating their own client instances. Now, the configuration types extend the library types directly, so all options are available.

  **@mastra/libsql** (Breaking)

  Renamed `connectionUrl` to `url` to match the `@libsql/client` API and align with LibSQLStorage.

  ```typescript
  // Before
  new LibSQLVector({ id: 'my-vector', connectionUrl: 'file:./db.sqlite' });

  // After
  new LibSQLVector({ id: 'my-vector', url: 'file:./db.sqlite' });
  ```

  **@mastra/opensearch** (Breaking)

  Renamed `url` to `node` and added support for all OpenSearch `ClientOptions` including authentication, SSL, and compression.

  ```typescript
  // Before
  new OpenSearchVector({ id: 'my-vector', url: 'http://localhost:9200' });

  // After
  new OpenSearchVector({ id: 'my-vector', node: 'http://localhost:9200' });

  // With authentication (now possible)
  new OpenSearchVector({
    id: 'my-vector',
    node: 'https://localhost:9200',
    auth: { username: 'admin', password: 'admin' },
    ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false },
  });
  ```

  **@mastra/pinecone** (Breaking)

  Removed `environment` parameter. Use `controllerHostUrl` instead (the actual Pinecone SDK field name). Added support for all `PineconeConfiguration` options.

  ```typescript
  // Before
  new PineconeVector({ id: 'my-vector', apiKey: '...', environment: '...' });

  // After
  new PineconeVector({ id: 'my-vector', apiKey: '...' });

  // With custom controller host (if needed)
  new PineconeVector({ id: 'my-vector', apiKey: '...', controllerHostUrl: '...' });
  ```

  **@mastra/clickhouse**

  Added support for all `ClickHouseClientConfigOptions` like `request_timeout`, `compression`, `keep_alive`, and `database`. Existing configurations continue to work unchanged.

  **@mastra/cloudflare, @mastra/cloudflare-d1, @mastra/lance, @mastra/libsql, @mastra/mongodb, @mastra/pg, @mastra/upstash**

  Improved logging by replacing `console.warn` with structured logger in workflow storage domains.

  **@mastra/deployer-cloud**

  Updated internal LibSQLVector configuration for compatibility with the new API.

- Fixed PostgreSQL storage issues after JSONB migration. ([#11906](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11906))

  **Bug Fixes**
  - Fixed `clearTable()` using incorrect default schema. The method was checking for table existence in the 'mastra' schema instead of PostgreSQL's default 'public' schema, causing table truncation to be skipped and leading to duplicate key violations in tests and production code that uses `dangerouslyClearAll()`.
  - Fixed `listWorkflowRuns()` status filter failing with "function regexp_replace(jsonb, ...) does not exist" error. After the TEXT to JSONB migration, the query tried to use `regexp_replace()` directly on a JSONB column. Now casts to text first: `regexp_replace(snapshot::text, ...)`.
  - Added Unicode sanitization when persisting workflow snapshots to handle null characters (\u0000) and unpaired surrogates (\uD800-\uDFFF) that PostgreSQL's JSONB type rejects, preventing "unsupported Unicode escape sequence" errors.

- Updated dependencies [[`ebae12a`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/ebae12a2dd0212e75478981053b148a2c246962d), [`c61a0a5`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/c61a0a5de4904c88fd8b3718bc26d1be1c2ec6e7), [`69136e7`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/69136e748e32f57297728a4e0f9a75988462f1a7), [`449aed2`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/449aed2ba9d507b75bf93d427646ea94f734dfd1), [`eb648a2`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/eb648a2cc1728f7678768dd70cd77619b448dab9), [`0131105`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/0131105532e83bdcbb73352fc7d0879eebf140dc), [`9d5059e`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/9d5059eae810829935fb08e81a9bb7ecd5b144a7), [`ef756c6`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/ef756c65f82d16531c43f49a27290a416611e526), [`b00ccd3`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/b00ccd325ebd5d9e37e34dd0a105caae67eb568f), [`3bdfa75`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/3bdfa7507a91db66f176ba8221aa28dd546e464a), [`e770de9`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/e770de941a287a49b1964d44db5a5763d19890a6), [`52e2716`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/52e2716b42df6eff443de72360ae83e86ec23993), [`27b4040`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/27b4040bfa1a95d92546f420a02a626b1419a1d6), [`610a70b`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/610a70bdad282079f0c630e0d7bb284578f20151), [`8dc7f55`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/8dc7f55900395771da851dc7d78d53ae84fe34ec), [`8379099`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/8379099fc467af6bef54dd7f80c9bd75bf8bbddf), [`8c0ec25`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/8c0ec25646c8a7df253ed1e5ff4863a0d3f1316c), [`ff4d9a6`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/ff4d9a6704fc87b31a380a76ed22736fdedbba5a), [`69821ef`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/69821ef806482e2c44e2197ac0b050c3fe3a5285), [`1ed5716`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/1ed5716830867b3774c4a1b43cc0d82935f32b96), [`4186bdd`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/4186bdd00731305726fa06adba0b076a1d50b49f), [`7aaf973`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/7aaf973f83fbbe9521f1f9e7a4fd99b8de464617)]:
  - @mastra/core@1.0.0-beta.22

## 1.0.0-beta.12

### Patch Changes

- Add embedded documentation support for Mastra packages ([#11472](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11472))

  Mastra packages now include embedded documentation in the published npm package under `dist/docs/`. This enables coding agents and AI assistants to understand and use the framework by reading documentation directly from `node_modules`.

  Each package includes:
  - **SKILL.md** - Entry point explaining the package's purpose and capabilities
  - **SOURCE_MAP.json** - Machine-readable index mapping exports to types and implementation files
  - **Topic folders** - Conceptual documentation organized by feature area

  Documentation is driven by the `packages` frontmatter field in MDX files, which maps docs to their corresponding packages. CI validation ensures all docs include this field.

- Added `startExclusive` and `endExclusive` options to `dateRange` filter for message queries. ([#11479](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11479))

  **What changed:** The `filter.dateRange` parameter in `listMessages()` and `Memory.recall()` now supports `startExclusive` and `endExclusive` boolean options. When set to `true`, messages with timestamps exactly matching the boundary are excluded from results.

  **Why this matters:** Enables cursor-based pagination for chat applications. When new messages arrive during a session, offset-based pagination can skip or duplicate messages. Using `endExclusive: true` with the oldest message's timestamp as a cursor ensures consistent pagination without gaps or duplicates.

  **Example:**

  ```typescript
  // Get first page
  const page1 = await memory.recall({
    threadId: 'thread-123',
    perPage: 10,
    orderBy: { field: 'createdAt', direction: 'DESC' },
  });

  // Get next page using cursor-based pagination
  const oldestMessage = page1.messages[page1.messages.length - 1];
  const page2 = await memory.recall({
    threadId: 'thread-123',
    perPage: 10,
    orderBy: { field: 'createdAt', direction: 'DESC' },
    filter: {
      dateRange: {
        end: oldestMessage.createdAt,
        endExclusive: true, // Excludes the cursor message
      },
    },
  });
  ```

- Fix thread timestamps being returned in incorrect timezone from listThreadsByResourceId ([#11498](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11498))

  The method was not using the timezone-aware columns (createdAtZ/updatedAtZ), causing timestamps to be interpreted in local timezone instead of UTC. Now correctly uses TIMESTAMPTZ columns with fallback for legacy data.

- Adds thread cloning to create independent copies of conversations that can diverge. ([#11517](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11517))

  ```typescript
  // Clone a thread
  const { thread, clonedMessages } = await memory.cloneThread({
    sourceThreadId: 'thread-123',
    title: 'My Clone',
    options: {
      messageLimit: 10, // optional: only copy last N messages
    },
  });

  // Check if a thread is a clone
  if (memory.isClone(thread)) {
    const source = await memory.getSourceThread(thread.id);
  }

  // List all clones of a thread
  const clones = await memory.listClones('thread-123');
  ```

  Includes:
  - Storage implementations for InMemory, PostgreSQL, LibSQL, Upstash
  - API endpoint: `POST /api/memory/threads/:threadId/clone`

  - @mastra/core@1.0.0-beta.20

## 1.0.0-beta.11

### Minor Changes

- Remove pg-promise dependency and use pg.Pool directly ([#11450](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11450))

  **BREAKING CHANGE**: This release replaces pg-promise with vanilla node-postgres (`pg`).

  ### Breaking Changes
  - **Removed `store.pgp`**: The pg-promise library instance is no longer exposed
  - **Config change**: `{ client: pgPromiseDb }` is no longer supported. Use `{ pool: pgPool }` instead
  - **Cloud SQL config**: `max` and `idleTimeoutMillis` must now be passed via `pgPoolOptions`

  ### New Features
  - **`store.pool`**: Exposes the underlying `pg.Pool` for direct database access or ORM integration (e.g., Drizzle)
  - **`store.db`**: Provides a `DbClient` interface with methods like `one()`, `any()`, `tx()`, etc.
  - **`store.db.connect()`**: Acquire a client for session-level operations

  ### Migration

  ```typescript
  // Before (pg-promise)
  import pgPromise from 'pg-promise';
  const pgp = pgPromise();
  const client = pgp(connectionString);
  const store = new PostgresStore({ id: 'my-store', client });

  // After (pg.Pool)
  import { Pool } from 'pg';
  const pool = new Pool({ connectionString });
  const store = new PostgresStore({ id: 'my-store', pool });

  // Use store.pool with any library that accepts a pg.Pool
  ```

### Patch Changes

- Added `exportSchemas()` function to generate Mastra database schema as SQL DDL without a database connection. ([#11448](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11448))

  **What's New**

  You can now export your Mastra database schema as SQL DDL statements without connecting to a database. This is useful for:
  - Generating migration scripts
  - Reviewing the schema before deployment
  - Creating database schemas in environments where the application doesn't have CREATE privileges

  **Example**

  ```typescript
  import { exportSchemas } from '@mastra/pg';

  // Export schema for default 'public' schema
  const ddl = exportSchemas();
  console.log(ddl);

  // Export schema for a custom schema
  const customDdl = exportSchemas('my_schema');
  // Creates: CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS "my_schema"; and all tables within it
  ```

  - @mastra/core@1.0.0-beta.19

## 1.0.0-beta.10

### Patch Changes

- Fix missing timezone columns during PostgreSQL spans table migration ([#11419](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11419))

  Fixes issue #11410 where users upgrading to observability beta.7 encountered errors about missing `startedAtZ`, `endedAtZ`, `createdAtZ`, and `updatedAtZ` columns. The migration now properly adds timezone-aware columns for all timestamp fields when upgrading existing databases, ensuring compatibility with the new observability implementation that requires these columns for batch operations.

- Add storage composition to MastraStorage ([#11401](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11401))

  `MastraStorage` can now compose storage domains from different adapters. Use it when you need different databases for different purposes - for example, PostgreSQL for memory and workflows, but a different database for observability.

  ```typescript
  import { MastraStorage } from '@mastra/core/storage';
  import { MemoryPG, WorkflowsPG, ScoresPG } from '@mastra/pg';
  import { MemoryLibSQL } from '@mastra/libsql';

  // Compose domains from different stores
  const storage = new MastraStorage({
    id: 'composite',
    domains: {
      memory: new MemoryLibSQL({ url: 'file:./local.db' }),
      workflows: new WorkflowsPG({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL }),
      scores: new ScoresPG({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL }),
    },
  });
  ```

  **Breaking changes:**
  - `storage.supports` property no longer exists
  - `StorageSupports` type is no longer exported from `@mastra/core/storage`

  All stores now support the same features. For domain availability, use `getStore()`:

  ```typescript
  const store = await storage.getStore('memory');
  if (store) {
    // domain is available
  }
  ```

  - @mastra/core@1.0.0-beta.16

## 1.0.0-beta.9

### Minor Changes

- Introduce StorageDomain base class for composite storage support ([#11249](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11249))

  Storage adapters now use a domain-based architecture where each domain (memory, workflows, scores, observability, agents) extends a `StorageDomain` base class with `init()` and `dangerouslyClearAll()` methods.

  **Key changes:**
  - Add `StorageDomain` abstract base class that all domain storage classes extend
  - Add `InMemoryDB` class for shared state across in-memory domain implementations
  - All storage domains now implement `dangerouslyClearAll()` for test cleanup
  - Remove `operations` from public `StorageDomains` type (now internal to each adapter)
  - Add flexible client/config patterns - domains accept either an existing database client or config to create one internally

  **Why this matters:**

  This enables composite storage where you can use different database adapters per domain:

  ```typescript
  import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core';
  import { PostgresStore } from '@mastra/pg';
  import { ClickhouseStore } from '@mastra/clickhouse';

  // Use Postgres for most domains but Clickhouse for observability
  const mastra = new Mastra({
    storage: new PostgresStore({
      connectionString: 'postgres://...',
    }),
    // Future: override specific domains
    // observability: new ClickhouseStore({ ... }).getStore('observability'),
  });
  ```

  **Standalone domain usage:**

  Domains can now be used independently with flexible configuration:

  ```typescript
  import { MemoryLibSQL } from '@mastra/libsql/memory';

  // Option 1: Pass config to create client internally
  const memory = new MemoryLibSQL({
    url: 'file:./local.db',
  });

  // Option 2: Pass existing client for shared connections
  import { createClient } from '@libsql/client';
  const client = createClient({ url: 'file:./local.db' });
  const memory = new MemoryLibSQL({ client });
  ```

  **Breaking changes:**
  - `StorageDomains` type no longer includes `operations` - access via `getStore()` instead
  - Domain base classes now require implementing `dangerouslyClearAll()` method

- Refactor storage architecture to use domain-specific stores via `getStore()` pattern ([#11361](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11361))

  ### Summary

  This release introduces a new storage architecture that replaces passthrough methods on `MastraStorage` with domain-specific storage interfaces accessed via `getStore()`. This change reduces code duplication across storage adapters and provides a cleaner, more modular API.

  ### Migration Guide

  All direct method calls on storage instances should be updated to use `getStore()`:

  ```typescript
  // Before
  const thread = await storage.getThreadById({ threadId });
  await storage.persistWorkflowSnapshot({ workflowName, runId, snapshot });
  await storage.createSpan(span);

  // After
  const memory = await storage.getStore('memory');
  const thread = await memory?.getThreadById({ threadId });

  const workflows = await storage.getStore('workflows');
  await workflows?.persistWorkflowSnapshot({ workflowName, runId, snapshot });

  const observability = await storage.getStore('observability');
  await observability?.createSpan(span);
  ```

  ### Available Domains
  - **`memory`**: Thread and message operations (`getThreadById`, `saveThread`, `saveMessages`, etc.)
  - **`workflows`**: Workflow state persistence (`persistWorkflowSnapshot`, `loadWorkflowSnapshot`, `getWorkflowRunById`, etc.)
  - **`scores`**: Evaluation scores (`saveScore`, `listScoresByScorerId`, etc.)
  - **`observability`**: Tracing and spans (`createSpan`, `updateSpan`, `getTrace`, etc.)
  - **`agents`**: Stored agent configurations (`createAgent`, `getAgentById`, `listAgents`, etc.)

  ### Breaking Changes
  - Passthrough methods have been removed from `MastraStorage` base class
  - All storage adapters now require accessing domains via `getStore()`
  - The `stores` property on storage instances is now the canonical way to access domain storage

  ### Internal Changes
  - Each storage adapter now initializes domain-specific stores in its constructor
  - Domain stores share database connections and handle their own table initialization

- Unified observability schema with entity-based span identification ([#11132](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11132))

  ## What changed

  Spans now use a unified identification model with `entityId`, `entityType`, and `entityName` instead of separate `agentId`, `toolId`, `workflowId` fields.

  **Before:**

  ```typescript
  // Old span structure
  span.agentId; // 'my-agent'
  span.toolId; // undefined
  span.workflowId; // undefined
  ```

  **After:**

  ```typescript
  // New span structure
  span.entityType; // EntityType.AGENT
  span.entityId; // 'my-agent'
  span.entityName; // 'My Agent'
  ```

  ## New `listTraces()` API

  Query traces with filtering, pagination, and sorting:

  ```typescript
  const { spans, pagination } = await storage.listTraces({
    filters: {
      entityType: EntityType.AGENT,
      entityId: 'my-agent',
      userId: 'user-123',
      environment: 'production',
      status: TraceStatus.SUCCESS,
      startedAt: { start: new Date('2024-01-01'), end: new Date('2024-01-31') },
    },
    pagination: { page: 0, perPage: 50 },
    orderBy: { field: 'startedAt', direction: 'DESC' },
  });
  ```

  **Available filters:** date ranges (`startedAt`, `endedAt`), entity (`entityType`, `entityId`, `entityName`), identity (`userId`, `organizationId`), correlation IDs (`runId`, `sessionId`, `threadId`), deployment (`environment`, `source`, `serviceName`), `tags`, `metadata`, and `status`.

  ## New retrieval methods
  - `getSpan({ traceId, spanId })` - Get a single span
  - `getRootSpan({ traceId })` - Get the root span of a trace
  - `getTrace({ traceId })` - Get all spans for a trace

  ## Backward compatibility

  The legacy `getTraces()` method continues to work. When you pass `name: "agent run: my-agent"`, it automatically transforms to `entityId: "my-agent", entityType: AGENT`.

  ## Migration

  **Automatic:** SQL-based stores (PostgreSQL, LibSQL, MSSQL) automatically add new columns to existing `spans` tables on initialization. Existing data is preserved with new columns set to `NULL`.

  **No action required:** Your existing code continues to work. Adopt the new fields and `listTraces()` API at your convenience.

### Patch Changes

- Fix severe performance issue with semantic recall on large message tables ([#11365](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11365))

  The `_getIncludedMessages` method was using `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY createdAt)` which scanned all messages in a thread to assign row numbers. On tables with 1M+ rows, this caused 5-10 minute query times.

  Replaced with cursor-based pagination using the existing `(thread_id, createdAt)` index:

  ```sql
  -- Before: scans entire thread
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY "createdAt" ASC)

  -- After: uses index, fetches only needed rows
  WHERE createdAt <= (target) ORDER BY createdAt DESC LIMIT N
  ```

  Performance improvement: ~49x faster (832ms → 17ms) for typical semantic recall queries.

- Added pre-configured client support for all storage adapters. ([#11302](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11302))

  **What changed**

  All storage adapters now accept pre-configured database clients in addition to connection credentials. This allows you to customize client settings (connection pools, timeouts, interceptors) before passing them to Mastra.

  **Example**

  ```typescript
  import { createClient } from '@clickhouse/client';
  import { ClickhouseStore } from '@mastra/clickhouse';

  // Create and configure client with custom settings
  const client = createClient({
    url: 'http://localhost:8123',
    username: 'default',
    password: '',
    request_timeout: 60000,
  });

  // Pass pre-configured client to store
  const store = new ClickhouseStore({
    id: 'my-store',
    client,
  });
  ```

  **Additional improvements**
  - Added input validation for required connection parameters (URL, credentials) with clear error messages

- Add index configuration options to storage stores ([#11311](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11311))

  Storage stores now support two new configuration options for index management:
  - `skipDefaultIndexes`: When `true`, default performance indexes are not created during `init()`. Useful for custom index strategies or reducing initialization time.
  - `indexes`: Array of custom index definitions to create during `init()`. Indexes are routed to the appropriate domain based on table/collection name.

  ```typescript
  // Skip default indexes and use custom ones
  const store = new PostgresStore({
    connectionString: '...',
    skipDefaultIndexes: true,
    indexes: [{ name: 'threads_type_idx', table: 'mastra_threads', columns: ["metadata->>'type'"] }],
  });

  // MongoDB equivalent
  const mongoStore = new MongoDBStore({
    url: 'mongodb://...',
    skipDefaultIndexes: true,
    indexes: [{ collection: 'mastra_threads', keys: { 'metadata.type': 1 }, options: { name: 'threads_type_idx' } }],
  });
  ```

  Domain classes (e.g., `MemoryPG`, `MemoryStorageMongoDB`) also accept these options for standalone usage.

  - @mastra/core@1.0.0-beta.15

## 1.0.0-beta.8

### Patch Changes

- Preserve error details when thrown from workflow steps ([#10992](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/10992))

  Workflow errors now retain custom properties like `statusCode`, `responseHeaders`, and `cause` chains. This enables error-specific recovery logic in your applications.

  **Before:**

  ```typescript
  const result = await workflow.execute({ input });
  if (result.status === 'failed') {
    // Custom error properties were lost
    console.log(result.error); // "Step execution failed" (just a string)
  }
  ```

  **After:**

  ```typescript
  const result = await workflow.execute({ input });
  if (result.status === 'failed') {
    // Custom properties are preserved
    console.log(result.error.message); // "Step execution failed"
    console.log(result.error.statusCode); // 429
    console.log(result.error.cause?.name); // "RateLimitError"
  }
  ```

  **Type change:** `WorkflowState.error` and `WorkflowRunState.error` types changed from `string | Error` to `SerializedError`.

  Other changes:
  - Added `UpdateWorkflowStateOptions` type for workflow state updates

- fix: make getSqlType consistent across storage adapters ([#11112](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11112))
  - PostgreSQL: use `getSqlType()` in `createTable` instead of `toUpperCase()`
  - LibSQL: use `getSqlType()` in `createTable`, return `JSONB` for jsonb type (matches SQLite 3.45+ support)
  - ClickHouse: use `getSqlType()` in `createTable` instead of `COLUMN_TYPES` constant, add missing types (uuid, float, boolean)
  - Remove unused `getSqlType()` and `getDefaultValue()` from `MastraStorage` base class (all stores use `StoreOperations` versions)

### Patch Changes

- Add delete workflow run API ([#10991](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/10991))

  ```typescript
  await workflow.deleteWorkflowRunById(runId);
  ```

- Add halfvec type support for large dimension embeddings ([#11002](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/11002))

  Adds `vectorType` option to `createIndex()` for choosing between full precision (`vector`) and half precision (`halfvec`) storage. halfvec uses 2 bytes per dimension instead of 4, enabling indexes on embeddings up to 4000 dimensions.

  ```typescript
  await pgVector.createIndex({
    indexName: 'large-embeddings',
    dimension: 3072, // text-embedding-3-large
    metric: 'cosine',
    vectorType: 'halfvec',
  });
  ```

  Requires pgvector >= 0.7.0 for halfvec support. Docker compose files updated to use pgvector 0.8.0.

## 1.0.0-beta.6

### Minor Changes

- Add stored agents support ([#10953](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/10953))

  Agents can now be stored in the database and loaded at runtime. This lets you persist agent configurations and dynamically create executable Agent instances from storage.

  ```typescript
  import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core';
  import { LibSQLStore } from '@mastra/libsql';

  const mastra = new Mastra({
    storage: new LibSQLStore({ url: ':memory:' }),
    tools: { myTool },
    scorers: { myScorer },
  });

  // Create agent in storage via API or directly
  await mastra.getStorage().createAgent({
    agent: {
      id: 'my-agent',
      name: 'My Agent',
      instructions: 'You are helpful',
      model: { provider: 'openai', name: 'gpt-4' },
      tools: { myTool: {} },
      scorers: { myScorer: { sampling: { type: 'ratio', rate: 0.5 } } },
    },
  });

  // Load and use the agent
  const agent = await mastra.getStoredAgentById('my-agent');
  const response = await agent.generate({ messages: 'Hello!' });

  // List all stored agents with pagination
  const { agents, total, hasMore } = await mastra.listStoredAgents({
    page: 0,
    perPage: 10,
  });
  ```

  Also adds a memory registry to Mastra so stored agents can reference memory instances by key.

## 1.0.0-beta.5

### Patch Changes

- Fix saveScore not persisting ID correctly, breaking getScoreById retrieval ([#10915](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/10915))

  **What Changed**
  - saveScore now correctly returns scores that can be retrieved with getScoreById
  - Validation errors now include contextual information (scorer, entity, trace details) for easier debugging

  **Impact**
  Previously, calling getScoreById after saveScore would return null because the generated ID wasn't persisted to the database. This is now fixed across all store implementations, ensuring consistent behavior and data integrity.

- PostgresStore was setting `this.stores = {}` in the constructor and only populating it in the async `init()` method. This broke Memory because it checks `storage.stores.memory` synchronously in `getInputProcessors()` before `init()` is called. ([#10943](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/10943))

  The fix moves domain instance creation to the constructor. This is safe because pg-promise creates database connections lazily when queries are executed.

  - @mastra/core@1.0.0-beta.8

## 1.0.0-beta.4

### Minor Changes

- Add `disableInit` option to all storage adapters ([#10851](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/10851))

  Adds a new `disableInit` config option to all storage providers that allows users to disable automatic table creation/migrations at runtime. This is useful for CI/CD pipelines where you want to run migrations during deployment with elevated credentials, then run the application with `disableInit: true` so it doesn't attempt schema changes at runtime.

  ```typescript
  // CI/CD script - run migrations
  const storage = new PostgresStore({
    connectionString: DATABASE_URL,
    id: 'pg-storage',
  });
  await storage.init();

  // Runtime - skip auto-init
  const storage = new PostgresStore({
    connectionString: DATABASE_URL,
    id: 'pg-storage',
    disableInit: true,
  });
  ```

### Patch Changes

- Standardize error IDs across all storage and vector stores using centralized helper functions (`createStorageErrorId` and `createVectorErrorId`). This ensures consistent error ID patterns (`MASTRA_STORAGE_{STORE}_{OPERATION}_{STATUS}` and `MASTRA_VECTOR_{STORE}_{OPERATION}_{STATUS}`) across the codebase for better error tracking and debugging.

## 1.0.0-beta.3

### Patch Changes

- fix(pg): qualify vector type to fix schema lookup ([#10786](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/10786))

- feat(storage): support querying messages from multiple threads ([#10663](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/10663))
  - Fixed TypeScript errors where `threadId: string | string[]` was being passed to places expecting `Scalar` type
  - Added proper multi-thread support for `listMessages` across all adapters when `threadId` is an array
  - Updated `_getIncludedMessages` to look up message threadId by ID (since message IDs are globally unique)
  - **upstash**: Added `msg-idx:{messageId}` index for O(1) message lookups (backwards compatible with fallback to scan for old messages, with automatic backfill)

- fix: ensure score responses match saved payloads for Mastra Stores. ([#10557](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/10557))

- Unify transformScoreRow functions across storage adapters ([#10648](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/10648))

  Added a unified `transformScoreRow` function in `@mastra/core/storage` that provides schema-driven row transformation for score data. This eliminates code duplication across 10 storage adapters while maintaining store-specific behavior through configurable options:
  - `preferredTimestampFields`: Preferred source fields for timestamps (PostgreSQL, Cloudflare D1)
  - `convertTimestamps`: Convert timestamp strings to Date objects (MSSQL, MongoDB, ClickHouse)
  - `nullValuePattern`: Skip values matching pattern (ClickHouse's `'_null_'`)
  - `fieldMappings`: Map source column names to schema fields (LibSQL's `additionalLLMContext`)

  Each store adapter now uses the unified function with appropriate options, reducing ~200 lines of duplicate transformation logic while ensuring consistent behavior across all storage backends.

## 1.0.0-beta.0

### Major Changes

- Moving scorers under the eval domain, api method consistency, prebuilt evals, scorers require ids. ([#9589](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9589))

- Every Mastra primitive (agent, MCPServer, workflow, tool, processor, scorer, and vector) now has a get, list, and add method associated with it. Each primitive also now requires an id to be set. ([#9675](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9675))

  Primitives that are added to other primitives are also automatically added to the Mastra instance

- Update handlers to use `listWorkflowRuns` instead of `getWorkflowRuns`. Fix type names from `StoragelistThreadsByResourceIdInput/Output` to `StorageListThreadsByResourceIdInput/Output`. ([#9507](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9507))

- **BREAKING:** Remove `getMessagesPaginated()` and add `perPage: false` support ([#9670](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9670))

  Removes deprecated `getMessagesPaginated()` method. The `listMessages()` API and score handlers now support `perPage: false` to fetch all records without pagination limits.

  **Storage changes:**
  - `StoragePagination.perPage` type changed from `number` to `number | false`
  - All storage implementations support `perPage: false`:
    - Memory: `listMessages()`
    - Scores: `listScoresBySpan()`, `listScoresByRunId()`, `listScoresByExecutionId()`
  - HTTP query parser accepts `"false"` string (e.g., `?perPage=false`)

  **Memory changes:**
  - `memory.query()` parameter type changed from `StorageGetMessagesArg` to `StorageListMessagesInput`
  - Uses flat parameters (`page`, `perPage`, `include`, `filter`, `vectorSearchString`) instead of `selectBy` object

  **Stricter validation:**
  - `listMessages()` requires non-empty, non-whitespace `threadId` (throws error instead of returning empty results)

  **Migration:**

  ```typescript
  // Storage/Memory: Replace getMessagesPaginated with listMessages
  - storage.getMessagesPaginated({ threadId, selectBy: { pagination: { page: 0, perPage: 20 } } })
  + storage.listMessages({ threadId, page: 0, perPage: 20 })
  + storage.listMessages({ threadId, page: 0, perPage: false })  // Fetch all

  // Memory: Replace selectBy with flat parameters
  - memory.query({ threadId, selectBy: { last: 20, include: [...] } })
  + memory.query({ threadId, perPage: 20, include: [...] })

  // Client SDK
  - thread.getMessagesPaginated({ selectBy: { pagination: { page: 0 } } })
  + thread.listMessages({ page: 0, perPage: 20 })
  ```

- # Major Changes ([#9695](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9695))

  ## Storage Layer

  ### BREAKING: Removed `storage.getMessages()`

  The `getMessages()` method has been removed from all storage implementations. Use `listMessages()` instead, which provides pagination support.

  **Migration:**

  ```typescript
  // Before
  const messages = await storage.getMessages({ threadId: 'thread-1' });

  // After
  const result = await storage.listMessages({
    threadId: 'thread-1',
    page: 0,
    perPage: 50,
  });
  const messages = result.messages; // Access messages array
  console.log(result.total); // Total count
  console.log(result.hasMore); // Whether more pages exist
  ```

  ### Message ordering default

  `listMessages()` defaults to ASC (oldest first) ordering by `createdAt`, matching the previous `getMessages()` behavior.

  **To use DESC ordering (newest first):**

  ```typescript
  const result = await storage.listMessages({
    threadId: 'thread-1',
    orderBy: { field: 'createdAt', direction: 'DESC' },
  });
  ```

  ## Client SDK

  ### BREAKING: Renamed `client.getThreadMessages()` → `client.listThreadMessages()`

  **Migration:**

  ```typescript
  // Before
  const response = await client.getThreadMessages(threadId, { agentId });

  // After
  const response = await client.listThreadMessages(threadId, { agentId });
  ```

  The response format remains the same.

  ## Type Changes

  ### BREAKING: Removed `StorageGetMessagesArg` type

  Use `StorageListMessagesInput` instead:

  ```typescript
  // Before
  import type { StorageGetMessagesArg } from '@mastra/core';

  // After
  import type { StorageListMessagesInput } from '@mastra/core';
  ```

- Bump minimum required Node.js version to 22.13.0 ([#9706](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9706))

- Add new list methods to storage API: `listMessages`, `listMessagesById`, `listThreadsByResourceId`, and `listWorkflowRuns`. Most methods are currently wrappers around existing methods. Full implementations will be added when migrating away from legacy methods. ([#9489](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9489))

- Rename RuntimeContext to RequestContext ([#9511](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9511))

- Implement listMessages API for replacing previous methods ([#9531](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9531))

- Remove `getThreadsByResourceId` and `getThreadsByResourceIdPaginated` methods from storage interfaces in favor of `listThreadsByResourceId`. The new method uses `offset`/`limit` pagination and a nested `orderBy` object structure (`{ field, direction }`). ([#9536](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9536))

- Remove `getMessagesById` method from storage interfaces in favor of `listMessagesById`. The new method only returns V2-format messages and removes the format parameter, simplifying the API surface. Users should migrate from `getMessagesById({ messageIds, format })` to `listMessagesById({ messageIds })`. ([#9534](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9534))

- Renamed a bunch of observability/tracing-related things to drop the AI prefix. ([#9744](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9744))

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Pagination APIs now use `page`/`perPage` instead of `offset`/`limit` ([#9592](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9592))

  All storage and memory pagination APIs have been updated to use `page` (0-indexed) and `perPage` instead of `offset` and `limit`, aligning with standard REST API patterns.

  **Affected APIs:**
  - `Memory.listThreadsByResourceId()`
  - `Memory.listMessages()`
  - `Storage.listWorkflowRuns()`

  **Migration:**

  ```typescript
  // Before
  await memory.listThreadsByResourceId({
    resourceId: 'user-123',
    offset: 20,
    limit: 10,
  });

  // After
  await memory.listThreadsByResourceId({
    resourceId: 'user-123',
    page: 2, // page = Math.floor(offset / limit)
    perPage: 10,
  });

  // Before
  await memory.listMessages({
    threadId: 'thread-456',
    offset: 20,
    limit: 10,
  });

  // After
  await memory.listMessages({
    threadId: 'thread-456',
    page: 2,
    perPage: 10,
  });

  // Before
  await storage.listWorkflowRuns({
    workflowName: 'my-workflow',
    offset: 20,
    limit: 10,
  });

  // After
  await storage.listWorkflowRuns({
    workflowName: 'my-workflow',
    page: 2,
    perPage: 10,
  });
  ```

  **Additional improvements:**
  - Added validation for negative `page` values in all storage implementations
  - Improved `perPage` validation to handle edge cases (negative values, `0`, `false`)
  - Added reusable query parser utilities for consistent validation in handlers

- ```([#9709](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9709))
  import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core';
  import { Observability } from '@mastra/observability';  // Explicit import

  const mastra = new Mastra({
    ...other_config,
    observability: new Observability({
      default: { enabled: true }
    })  // Instance
  });
  ```

  Instead of:

  ```
  import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core';
  import '@mastra/observability/init';  // Explicit import

  const mastra = new Mastra({
    ...other_config,
    observability: {
      default: { enabled: true }
    }
  });
  ```

  Also renamed a bunch of:
  - `Tracing` things to `Observability` things.
  - `AI-` things to just things.

- Removed old tracing code based on OpenTelemetry ([#9237](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9237))

- Mark as stable ([`83d5942`](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/commit/83d5942669ce7bba4a6ca4fd4da697a10eb5ebdc))

- Renamed `MastraMessageV2` to `MastraDBMessage` ([#9255](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9255))
  Made the return format of all methods that return db messages consistent. It's always `{ messages: MastraDBMessage[] }` now, and messages can be converted after that using `@mastra/ai-sdk/ui`'s `toAISdkV4/5Messages()` function

- moved ai-tracing code into @mastra/observability ([#9661](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9661))

- Remove legacy evals from Mastra ([#9491](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/9491))

### Minor Changes

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 704d1ca: Thread Timestamp Auto-Update Enhancement
  Added automatic thread updatedAt timestamp updates when messages are saved across all storage providers
  Enhanced user experience: Threads now accurately reflect their latest activity with automatic timestamp updates when new messages are added
  Universal implementation: Consistent behavior across all 7 storage backends (ClickHouse, Cloudflare D1, DynamoDB, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Upstash, LibSQL)
  Performance optimized: Updates execute in parallel with message saving operations for minimal performance impact
  Backwards compatible: No breaking changes - existing code continues to work unchanged
  Improved conversation ordering: Chat interfaces can now properly sort threads by actual last activity
  This enhancement resolves the issue where active conversations appeared stale due to outdated thread timestamps, providing better conversation management and user experience in chat applications.
